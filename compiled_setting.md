# World Meta
#### What is World Meta?
>Your World Meta is the basic principles of your worldbuilding project, a document to reference whenever you’re stuck with your worldbuilding, novel or campaign. As your world grows, your Foundation may evolve, but you shouldn’t violate your basic principles.

#### Why should I use World Meta?
>World Meta helps protect you against a lot of things!
>-   If you get **stuck**, or **lose motivation**, referencing your meta will get you back on track.
>-   World Meta also acts as a **sense check** for your world, ensuring that what you’re adding makes sense with your larger creative vision
>-   World Meta is a great springboard to start your world from, and also a great source of inspiration when you want to open up a new part of your world - a new solar system, continent, region or plane.

#### How do I fill this out?
>**Keep your answers brief**, just simple sentences and paragraphs. You’ll be referencing this document a lot, and brief prose will help you find answers quickly!
>
If you have **additional ideas** you don’t want to lose, add them to your World Anvil notebook, or make brief articles using the purple button at the bottom right! You can expand these ideas later.
>
Reference previous answers to help you answer the next question! For example, if your **audience experience** was “a raw, prehistoric-feeling world” then choose a very volcanically active geography, and add dinosaurs or wooly mammoths!

>-   For example, if your **Motivation** is “to recapture your love of Saturday morning cartoons”, you might want to choose a superhero genre in the **genre section**.
>-   For example, if your **audience experience** was “a raw, prehistoric-feeling world” then choose a very volcanically active geography, and add dinosaurs or wooly mammoths!

#### How do I use this later?
>Whenever you’re stuck, or just wondering what to do next, come back to these meta documents.
>-   Need inspiration for a new quest or subplot? Dig into your genre, or even your current affairs for inspiration!
>-   Can’t decide what something should look like? Refer back to your themes, your tone, or your inspiration board.
>-   What should you build next? From here, especially the scene section, you’ll get ideas about organizations, nations, religions, traditions, languages and more.
>-   Feeling lost? Revisit your motivation and your Hook - they’ll get you back to the core of what you’re doing, and why!

## Scope
>**Keep track of WHY you're creating**
Stay on track and make your world, campaign or novel the very best it can be! It all starts with a little motivation...

### What is your motivation for building this world?
>Decide what the world is being built for, and what it means to you - that way, it’ll be fit for purpose!

### What are you hoping to get out of it?
>Knowing what you want from your worldbuilding project will help keep you on track when you get tired or stuck. Are you creating for a novel or a D&D campaign? What kind of experience do you want your audience to have?

### What is the hook or unique selling point of you world? What makes it different?
>This is the core of your idea, the hook that draws you - and hopefully your players and readers - into the setting of the world.
>
When we say “Unique” we really mean “special to you”. As long as you’re excited about the concept, that’s enough. Don’t feel like you have to reinvent the wheel and come up with something 100% original.

## Theme
>**Instill clarity and consistency to your storytelling.**
From the darkest dungeon to the brightest rainbow, choose the look and feel of your world, and how noble (or grim) your heroes’ fates will be!

### What's the genre of your world?
>Knowing the genre(s) and general technology/magic level will help you set expectations about your world, and keep your world feeling cohesive.

### How does the world feel (player/reader experience)?
>Do you want your world to feel mystical, or terrifying - or both? Should your audience be afraid or moved, filled with wanderlust or wonder? Awed by the past, or by the future? Your world will have a general feel to it, even if the specifics of tone vary from story to story.

### What is the character agency level like?
>Character agency describes how much power the main characters or player characters have to change the world, and how long-lasting that change might be.\*
>
These motifs are a great way to help reinforce the feeling of your world, despite the different pacing and mood of locations or scenes within your story or campaign. They do not need to feature in every single session or scene.

### What is the tone of your world?
>Is your world  

>- **dark** (e.g. Game of Thrones, Battlestar Galactica, The Witcher)  
>- or **bright** (e.g. original Star Trek, the Princess Bride, My Little Pony),  
>- or **somewhere in the middle** (e.g. StarGate, Harry Potter, Shannara Chronicles)? 
>
How pleasant or difficult is it to live there, in general? Do horrible or wondrous things happen to ordinary people?

### What are the recurring themes which reinforce the genre, tone and feel of your world?
>A few recurring themes can help anchor your audience in your tone and genre, and establish your hook. What three motifs/scenes/themes capture the world you’re trying to create?*
>
*(give three to five examples)

## Focus
> **Focus the subjects you will be expanding on.**
>
*Choose three to five focal points of your world to focus your worldbuilding on.**  
It’s a sad truth of worldbuilding that you can’t create EVERYTHING! Decide a few focus points* you want to expand on. This will give the impression that your world is very deep and detailed. You can always expand more areas later!
>
**Examples might include (this list is not exhaustive!)**
>-   Government Presence
>-   Rule Of Law
>-   Social Services
>-   Economic Strength
>-   Wealth Distribution
>-   Agriculture And Trade
>-   Race Relations
>-   Class Relations
>-   Gender Relations
>-   Sexual Orientation Relations
>-   Military Influence
>-   Religious Influence
>-   Technology Influence
>-   Arts And Culture Influence

### First Focus Point


### Second Focus Point


### Third Focus Point


### Ancillary/Expanded Focus Points


## Drama
> **Adding drama is the way to put your world in motion**
>
*Add 5 points of drama to your world. *
Drama is the current affairs of your world - what’s happening right now. You can use one or two of them for your main plot line, but the rest are just there to create the impression of a larger world in motion. Drama is a great source not only of side quests and B plots, but also of background dialogue!  
>  
If you need to add more, use this expanded section

### Drama Point 1


### Drama Point 2


### Drama Point 3


### Drama Point 4


### Drama Point 5


### Expanded Drama
>Fill here any other minor drama points that are either local or personal to the characters / party and/or story you are currently exploring.


## Scene
>**Describe your world's basic properties**
Make your setting feel unique with strange geographical quirks, bizarre weather, and deep magic.

### What are the fundamental differences in the natural laws of your world compared to Earth? (Rules of the world)
>Does your world have magic or altered gravity, midichlorians or psionics? Are the gods wandering the world? Nail down your world’s natural laws now - they will have fundamental repercussions on everything else in your world!
>
*Make sure you sense-check with your previous answers - if your genre is hard sci-fi, you might not want to introduce magic, for example.

### How did this world come to be? (Cosmology)
>The dominant religion, The Children of the Suns, believes that the world is the child of the twin suns, La and Tho. In reality, the world was intentionally created from a nebula by aliens who will be back to check on it someday...
>
Write how your world ACTUALLY came to be - was it born from an egg, created by a god, or sneezed into being? You can add the prevalent in-world belief if you like. Just one paragraph on this - don't go full Silmarillion!

### What the geography of your world look like? Does your geography have any special properties or features?
>This should be a generic vision of your geography. Is your world full of volcanos and lava flows or floating islands? Is it an ice planet, or a desert waste? Is it a planet-city like Coruscant? Is it bio-diverse or all the same?
>
From winters which last decades (Game of Thrones, G.R.R. Martin) to moons which throw destructive spores (World of Pern, Anne MacCaffery ), extraordinary geographical features can add character and challenges to your world. What are the fundamental truths of the physical geography of your world?
>
**Remember to refer back to your genre, tone and motifs in your Foundation! They’ll give you a tonne of inspiration for this.**

### What is the initial size of your active seeing?
>What is the initial scale* of your active storytelling space? An island, a region or a continent, for example?
>
Defining your initial active setting doesn’t mean your players or main characters can’t go elsewhere! But it does help you create a starting point which feels rich and alive.
>
Remember this will be affected by the genre! If you’re playing a Star Trek campaign, you’ll be exploring different planets, so an active area might be a solar system or a cluster of systems.

## People
>**Explore the impact of sentience in your world**
Breathe life into your world with great fallen empires, forgotten cities and lost civilizations. Add conflict and drama with the struggles and politics of today.

### Who used to live here, and what's their history?
>Write max. 1 paragraph on each lost civilization that was active in the area. Remember you can always add more later, which have not yet been discovered!
>
This is where the unknown mysteries come from, and a great source of dungeons, secrets, adventures, unique items and more. Also makes your world feel living and established. If you want your world to feel brand new and unsettled, write instead about the geological history of your world - the fossils that people will find.

### Which species/cultures live here now and what's their history?
>Keep it brief! A paragraph is enough for the major civilizations. A sentence is plenty for any minor cultures which might be part of the adventure. Add other cultures not in your main storytelling area in one additional sentence.

### What do they need, and what do they need from each other?
>For each group, limit your answer to one paragraph, and remember to include one sentence on their opinion of "others". Detail other cultures not in your main storytelling area in one additional sentence.
>
For example, who are they? What do they look like? Start with a little bit of history, and then turn that into an attitude and a need.

## Inspiration
>**Stay inspired and focused, create an anchor to reinvigorate your passion**
Inspiration, inspiration, inspiration! What movies, music, art and ideas have inspired your world setting?
>
Collect all the different media references together here, to create a grand library of inspiration tailored to your world. Come back whenever you want to recapture the mood or get inspired for a new writing sprint!
>
Make sure you add notes to detail WHAT in each piece of media inspires you. Marking what you love about your references will help you when you come back later!
>
For example, for a “treasure seeking amongst the stars” setting, you might add both “Indiana Jones” and “Star Trek”. You love the dungeon-delving aspect of Indiana Jones, but your world is more like Star Trek from a genre and technology standpoint.

# Book\Silvermeet - 01.md

During a lonely night at the village of [[Silvermeet]], south of [[Kingscross]] and the [[Blackrock Highlands]], while the wind howled and the pines cracked from its movement, the air was humid and smelled like moss after a full day's rain, and the tiny-soaked birds now chirped atop an old tavern's roof made of straws and lumber, an old man walked into the warm, comforting ambient from the harsh, winter-cold streets. Little did he know, that would be his last day as the man he knew himself to be.

Localizada na costa do [[Kesh Desert]], Varatha é uma cidade costeira construída ao redor do Rio Varathos e com vista para a Baía dos Vitrais.

Varatha é uma cidade antiga fundada na primeira metade da 4ª era, anterior ao estabelecimento do Império Kesh. Ela se destaca como um marco histórico e cultural dentro do Deserto de Kesh, refletindo séculos de civilização e conhecimento.

Varatha é uma cidade autônoma dentro do Império Keshen. O príncipe Abit, um androsfinge imortal disfarçado de nobre élfico, governa Varatha com autonomia concedida pelo Imperador Darion Ajakx.

Varatha é o último bastião da civilização antes que o [[Kesh Desert]] dê lugar às [[Lost Plains]]. At No delta do Rio Varathos, perto da Floresta Anciã, a população de Varatha vem de diversas culturas, predominantemente humanos, draconatos e elfos.

Varatha opera sob uma estrutura governamental única devido à parceria do Príncipe Abit com o Império Kesh. Abit, um androsphinx disfarçado, tem sido o governante de Varatha por milênios, impondo estabilidade por meio de força e sabedoria. Enquanto a cidade segue as leis do império na maioria dos aspectos, ela tem privilégios de autogoverno em áreas como comércio e leis locais, uma condição negociada com o Imperador Darion.

O príncipe Abit, como governante de Varatha, trabalha em estreita colaboração com o Conselho da Cidade, que serve como um órgão consultivo com autoridade sobre regulamentações em andamento. As cadeiras do conselho são divididas entre guildas, templos e a academia. Os representantes cumprem mandatos de cinco anos sem reeleição consecutiva, e o presidente da assembleia é nomeado por Abit para um mandato de dez anos, elegível para apenas uma nomeação.

### Plane of Fire
Fire represents vibrancy, passion, and change. At its worst, it is cruel and wantonly destructive, as the efreet often are, but at its best, fire reflects the light of inspiration, the warmth of compassion, and the flame of desire. 
A blazing sun hangs at the zenith of a golden sky above the Plane of Fire, waxing and waning on a 21-hour cycle. It ranges from white hot at noon to deep red at midnight, so the darkest hours of the plane display a deep red twilight. At noon, the light is nearly blinding. Most business in the City of Brass (see below) takes place during the darker hours.

# **Bem-vindo a Val**

## **É tempo de guerra. . .**

Oito séculos depois da Grande Guerra e da queda dos Impérios Élficos, o continente de Val se reconfigura em face de novos poderes. Efervescendo no periférico Deserto de Kesh, o Novo Império Kesh, comandado pelo imperador Darion Ajakx, vive sua campanha de expansão e os desafios de uma potência emergente.

30 anos depois da Guerra da União Partida, que dividiu os Campos de Alabastro e anexou as terras de Adama e Epis ao Império Kesh, a conquista do imperador Ajakx se volta para o oeste, sobre o domínio sombrio dos elfos de Sahzet.

Vocês são **cinco** **aventureiros de nível 1** que, por algum motivo, estão no vilarejo de Ippan, a dois dias de Varatha, a segunda maior cidade em Kesh. Na noite do segundo dia do mês de Baran do ano 837 da 5ª Era, a taverna Lareira do Oásis serve como um refúgio do calor escaldante do verão, e os clientes habituais dividem o espaço com visitantes da cidade grande, em clima de festa mas estranheza pela presença de uma caravana imperial.

## **Você pode ser um. . .**
- **Humano**: Você é maioria em Val. Essa é a sua terra. As estradas, fazendas, cidades e castelos foram construídos pelos seus ancestrais, seja desbravando o vasto continente, ou por cima das ruínas de antigas civilizações.
- **Elfo**: Seu povo é herdeiro dos grandes impérios élficos da 4ª Era. Você representa um passado de glória, mas também de dominação. As grandes cidades (das que sboraram) provavelmente foram contruídas pelos seus ancestrais, por mais que os novos impérios as tenham reconfigurado para apagar a hisória élifca.
- **Anão**: Senhores das montanhas, os anões preservaram algumas das comunidades mais antigas em Val. Mestres artesãos e estrategístas, os reinos dos anões se preservaram razoalvelmente neutros nos conflítos externos dos últimos séculos, mas têm tido seus dilemas, montanha adentro.
- **Halfling**: Residentes dos campos e pradarias, o halflings são, na maioria das vezes, amigáveis e adorados por todos.
- **Meio-Elfo**: Fruto de uma época em que elfos e humanos viviam em harmonia, ou originário de um dos poucos lugares que ainda mantêm essa paz, você anda entre dois mundos, mas realmente não pertence a nenhum deles.
- **Draconato:** Familiarizados com a vida em clãs, os draconatos raramente vivem entre outras raças. Com exceção da sua forte presença no Deserto de Kesh, eles são vistos no resto do mundo como símbolo da grandiosidade dracônica ou como monstros selvagens.
- **Meio-Orc**: Marginalizados e temidos, os meio-orcs lutam contra suas heranças de barbaridade e violência, enalquanto tentam se integrar em uma sociedade que raramente os tolera.
- **Tiefling**: Descendente de uma linhagem infernal, você invoca medo e superstição por onde passa. Raros são os lugares onde olhares desdenhosos não se voltam a você, e os poucos da sua raça que atingiram notoriedade o fizeram por uma combinação de esfroço e sorte inomináveis.
- **Gnomo**: Curiosos e engenhosos, os gnomos são pequenos inventores e naturalmente mágicos. Habitantes de florestas antigas ou enclaves escondidos, gnomos formam comunidades unidas, sendo conhecidos por sua criatividade e sua capacidade de enxergar o mundo com entusiasmo.
- **Entre outras opções**!

## **Os Grandes Deuses de Aquarius**

O mundo de Aquarius é lar de inúmeras divindades, de todos os tipos. Abaixo estão os Deuses (bons) mais cultuados em Val:

# D&D\D&D Rules\Appendices\Conditions.md

# Appendix A: Conditions
---
Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as [[Conditions#Blinded|blinded]], are impairments, but a few, such as [[Conditions#Invisible|invisible]], can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the [[Conditions#Prone|prone]] condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.

## Blinded
---
-   A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
-   Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

## Charmed
---
-   A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
-   The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

## Deafened
---
-   A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.

## Exhaustion
---
Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.

| Level | Effect                         |
|:-----:| ------------------------------ |
| 1     | Disadvantage on ability checks |
| 2     | Speed halved |
| 3     | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws 
| 4     | Hit point maximum halved |
| 5     | Speed reduced to 0 |
| 6     | Death |

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.  
Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1.

## Frightened
---
-   A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
-   The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

## Grappled
---
-   A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
-   The condition ends if the grappler is [[Conditions#Incapacitated|incapacitated]] (see the condition).
-   The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the [[Thunderwave|thunderwave]] spell.

## Incapacitated
---
-   An incapacitated creature can't take actions or reactions.

## Invisible
---
-   An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
-   Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.

## Paralyzed
---
-   A paralyzed creature is [[Conditions#Incapacitated|incapacitated]] (see the condition) and can't move or speak.
-   The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
-   Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

## Petrified
---
-   A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.
-   The creature is [[Conditions#Incapacitated|incapacitated]] (see the condition), can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.
-   Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
-   The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
-   The creature has resistance to all damage.
-   The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.

## Poisoned
---
-   A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

## Prone
---
-   A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
-   The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
-   An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

## Restrained
---
-   A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
-   Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
-   The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

## Stunned
---
-   A stunned creature is [[Conditions#Incapacitated|incapacitated]] (see the condition), can't move, and can speak only falteringly.
-   The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
-   Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

## Unconscious
---
-   An unconscious creature is [[Conditions#Incapacitated|incapacitated]], can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.
-   The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls [[Conditions#Prone|prone]].
-   The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
-   Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
-   Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

# Barbarian

A tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard, draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his people’s elk herd.

A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.

Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.

These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.

For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.

## Primal Instinct

People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one’s own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature—keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.

Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.

## A Life of Danger

Not every member of the tribes deemed “barbarians” by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don’t have to.

Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.

## Creating a Barbarian

When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common?

What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to “civilized” lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.

> **QUICK BUILD**
> 
> You can make a barbarian quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the outlander background.

### The Barbarian Table

TABLE HEEBE JEEBE

## Class Features

As a barbarian, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d12 per barbarian level  
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 12 + your Constitution modifier  
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per barbarian level after 1st

#### Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, shields  
**Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons  
**Tools:** None  
**Saving Throws:** Strength, Constitution  
**Skills:** Choose two from [Animal Handling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AnimalHandling), [Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics), [Intimidation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Intimidation), [Nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Nature), [Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception), and [Survival](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival)

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

-   (a) a greataxe or (b) any martial melee weapon
-   (a) two handaxes or (b) any simple weapon
-   An explorer’s pack and four javelins

#### Rage

In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:

-   You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
-   When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
-   You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious) or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.

#### Unarmored Defense

While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

#### Reckless Attack

Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

#### Danger Sense

At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.

You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded), [deafened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Deafened), or [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated).

#### Primal Path

At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. The Path of the Berserker is detailed at the end of the class description, and additional primal paths are available in other sources. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

#### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

#### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack) action on your turn.

#### Fast Movement

Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.

#### Feral Instinct

By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated), you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.

#### Brutal Critical

Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.

#### Relentless Rage

Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

#### Brutal Critical

At 13th level, you can roll two additional weapon damage dice when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

This increases to three additional dice at 17th level.

#### Persistent Rage

Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious) or if you choose to end it.

#### Brutal Critical

At 17th level, you can roll three additional weapon damage dice when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

#### Indomitable Might

Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

#### Primal Champion

At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.

## Primal Paths

Rage burns in every barbarian’s heart, a furnace that drives him or her toward greatness. Different barbarians attribute their rage to different sources, however. For some, it is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of a totem animal.

## Path of the Berserker

For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end—that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.

#### Frenzy

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion).

#### Mindless Rage

Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed) or [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened) while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.

#### Intimidating Presence

Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened) of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened) creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.

#### Retaliation

Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

# Druid
Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf summons the fury of the storm and calls down explosive bolts of lightning to smite the torch-carrying orcs who threaten her forest.

Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a leopard, a human peers out of the jungle at the strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the cultists’ activities.

Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf charges into a mass of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the mocking semblance of life.

Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature’s resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature’s indomitable will.

## Power of Nature
Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.

Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals—the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.

## Preserve the Balance
For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world—air, earth, fire, and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.

Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids’ territory.

Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature’s balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.

## Creating a Druid
When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character’s destiny.

Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.

> **QUICK BUILD**

> You can make a druid quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background.

> **SACRED PLANTS AND WOOD**
> 
> A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.
> 
> Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.
> 
> Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.

> **DRUIDS AND THE GODS**
> 
> Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers, and others who live closely with nature. This tradition includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory, the Oerth Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa.
> 
> In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith of a single nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus, Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury: Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are often called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and most druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy of veneration.
> 
> The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of the other religions of the world. They believe that every living thing and every natural phenomenon—sun, moon, wind, fire, and the world itself—has a spirit. Their spells, then, are a means to communicate with and command these spirits. Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other and to the forces of civilization. The Ashbound, for example, believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature, the Children of Winter venerate the forces of death, and the Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the world from the incursion of aberrations.

## Class Features

As a druid, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per druid level  
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier  
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per druid level after 1st

#### Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal)  
**Weapons:** Clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, maces, quarterstaffs, scimitars, sickles, slings, spears  
**Tools:** Herbalism kit  
**Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Wisdom  
**Skills:** Choose two from [[Ability Scores#Arcana|Arcana]], [[Ability Scores#Animal Handling|Animal Handling]], [[Ability Scores#Insight|Insight]], [[Ability Scores#Medicine|Medicine]], [[Ability Scores#Nature|Nature]], [[Ability Scores#Perception|Perception]], [[Ability Scores#Religion|Religion]], and [[Ability Scores#Survival|Survival]]

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

-   (a) a wooden shield or (b) any simple weapon
-   (a) a scimitar or (b) any simple melee weapon
-   Leather armor, an explorer’s pack, and a druidic focus

#### Druidic

You know [[Druidic]], the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([[Ability Scores#Perception|Perception]]) check but can’t decipher it without magic.

#### Spellcasting

Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See [Spells Rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting "Spells Rules") for the general rules of spellcasting and the [Spells Listing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=3&filter-search=&filter-sub-class=&filter-concentration=&filter-ritual=&filter-unlocked-content= "Spells Listing (Druid)") for the druid spell list.

##### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell [cure wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/cure-wounds), you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

##### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** \= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** \= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

##### Ritual Casting

You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

##### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a druidic focus (see the [Adventuring Gear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#DruidicFocus "Adventuring Gear") section) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

#### Wild Shape

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed.

</table></div>

You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall [unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Unconscious), drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

-   Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.
-   When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked [[Conditions#Unconscious|unconscious]].
-   You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as [[Call Lightning|call lightning]], that you’ve already cast.
-   You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision), unless your new form also has that sense.
-   You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

#### Druid Circle

At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land detailed at the end of the class description or one from the Player's Handbook or other sources. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

#### Wild Shape Improvement 1

At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

#### Wild Shape Improvement 2

At 8th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1 or lower. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Timeless Body

Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

#### Beast Spells

Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components.

#### Archdruid

At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.

Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.

## Druid Circles

Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders, druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All druids are nominally members of this druidic society, though some individuals are so isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking members of the society or participated in druidic gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and sisters. Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids sometimes compete with or even prey on each other.

At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the way of the druid.

## Circle of the Land

The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites.

#### Bonus Cantrip

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.

#### Natural Recovery

Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.

#### Circle Spells

Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land — arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark — and consult the associated list of spells.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

#### Land’s Stride

Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the [[Entangle|entangle]] spell.

#### Nature’s Ward

When you reach 10th level, you can’t be [[Conditions#Charmed|charmed]] or [[Conditions#Frightened|frightened]] by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.

#### Nature’s Sanctuary

When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.

# Monk
Her fists a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of arrows, a half-elf springs over a barricade and throws herself into the massed ranks of hobgoblins on the other side. She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.

Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging orcs reach him, he exhales and a blast of fire roars from his mouth, engulfing his foes.

Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad halfling steps into a shadow beneath an arch and emerges from another inky shadow on a balcony a stone’s throw away. She slides her blade free of its cloth-wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.

Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.

## The Magic of Ki

Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic traditions call ki. This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the multiverse—specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies’ physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.

## Training and Asceticism

Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&D, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn’t be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.

Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power.

The majority of monks don’t shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants.

For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don’t undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure.

## Creating a Monk

As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery’s threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?

Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community’s rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?

As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness ki, monks are almost always lawful in alignment.

> You can make a monk quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the hermit background.

# Class Features

As a monk, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per monk level  
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier  
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per monk level after 1st

#### Proficiencies

**Armor:** None  
**Weapons:** Simple weapons, shortswords  
**Tools:** Choose one type of artisan’s tools or one musical instrument  
**Saving Throws:** Strength, Dexterity  
**Skills:** Choose two from [Acrobatics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics), [Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics), [History](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#History), [Insight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Insight), [Religion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Religion), and [Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth)

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

-   (a) a shortsword or (b) any simple weapon
-   (a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack
-   10 darts

#### Unarmored Defense

Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.

#### Martial Arts

At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:

-   You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.
-   You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
-   When you use the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack) action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack) action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.

Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in the [Weapons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Weapons "Weapons") section.

#### Ki

Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.

You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: **Flurry of Blows**, **Patient Defense**, and **Step of the Wind**. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.

Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Ki save DC** \= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

##### Flurry of Blows

Immediately after you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack) action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

##### Patient Defense

You can spend 1 ki point to take the [Dodge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dodge) action as a bonus action on your turn.

##### Step of the Wind

You can spend 1 ki point to take the [Disengage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Disengage) or [Dash](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dash) action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

#### Unarmored Movement

Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.

At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.

#### Monastic Tradition

When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

#### Deflect Missiles

Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

#### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

#### Slow Fall

Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.

#### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack) action on your turn.

#### Stunning Strike

Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be [[Conditions#Stunned\|stunned]] until the end of your next turn.

#### Ki-Empowered Strikes

Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

#### Unarmored Movement

At 6th level, your Unarmored Speed speed bonus increases to 15 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield.

#### Evasion

At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a [[Fireball\|fireball]] spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

#### Stillness of Mind

Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be [[Conditions#Charmed\|charmed]] or [[Conditions#Frightened\|frightened]].

#### Unarmored Movement Improvement

At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during your move.

#### Purity of Body

At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.

#### Unarmored Movement

At 10th level, your Unarmored Speed speed bonus increases to 20 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield.

#### Tongue of the Sun and Moon

Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.

#### Diamond Soul

Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.

#### Unarmored Movement

At 14th level, your Unarmored Speed speed bonus increases to 25 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield.

#### Timeless Body

At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.

#### Empty Body

Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become [[Conditions#Invisible\|invisible]] for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.

Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the [astral projection](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/astral-projection) spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with you.

#### Unarmored Movement

At 18th level, your Unarmored Speed speed bonus increases to 30 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield.

#### Perfect Self

At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.

# Monastic Traditions
Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.

## Way of the Cobalt Soul
Driven by the pursuit of knowledge and their worship of the Knowing Mentor, the archives of the Cobalt Soul stand as some of the most well-respected and most heavily guarded repositories of tomes, history, and information across Exandria. Here, young people seeking the clarity of truth and the strength of knowledge pledge to learn the arts of seeking enlightenment by understanding the world around them, and mastering the techniques to defend it. To become a Cobalt Soul is to give one’s self to the quest for unveiling life’s mysteries, bringing light to the secrets of the dark, and guarding the most powerful and dangerous of truths from those who would seek to perverse the sanctity of civilization.

The monks of the Cobalt Soul are the embodiment of the phrase “know your enemy”. Through research, they prepare themselves against the ever-coming tides of evil. Through careful training, they have learned to puncture and manipulate the spiritual flow of an opponent’s body. Through understanding the secrets of their foe, they can adapt and surmount them. Then, once the fight is done, they return to record their findings for future generations of monks to study from.

#### Extract Aspects

Beginning at 3rd level when choosing this tradition, you can strike pressure points to extract crucial information about your foe, granting you insight about their combat ability. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you mark them as analyzed. Whenever an analyzed creature misses you with an attack, you can immediately use your reaction to make an unarmed melee attack against that creature. This benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest.

In addition, you learn the following attributes about the target: Damage Vulnerabilities, Damage Resistances, Damage Immunities, and Condition Immunities.

#### Extort Truth

At 6th level, you can hit a hidden cluster of nerves on a creature with precision, temporarily causing them to become mentally malleable. If you hit a creature with an unarmed attack, you can spend 1 ki point to force them to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is unable to speak a deliberate lie and all Charisma checks directed at the creature are made with advantage for up to 10 minutes. You know if they succeeded or failed on their saving throw.

An affected creature is aware of the effect and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as the effect lasts.

#### Mystical Erudition

Beginning at 6th level, you’ve undergone extensive training with the Cobalt Soul, teaching you extensively in history or lore from the monastery’s collected volumes. You learn one language of your choice, and you gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice: [Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Arcana), [History](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#History), [Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation), [Nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Nature), and [Religion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Religion). If you already have proficiency in one of the listed skills, you can instead choose to double your proficiency bonus for any ability check you make that uses the chosen proficiency.

You gain an additional language and an additional skill proficiency from the above list (with the ability to double the bonus of an existing proficiency from the list) at 11th and 17th level.

#### Mind of Mercury

Starting at 11th level, you’ve honed your awareness and reflexes through mental aptitude and pattern recognition. Once per turn, if you’ve already taken your reaction, you may spend 1 ki point to take an additional reaction.

#### Mystical Erudition (Additional)

You gain an additional language and an additional skill proficiency from the above list at 11th level. If you already have proficiency in one of the listed skills, you can instead choose to double your proficiency bonus for any ability check you make that uses the chosen proficiency.

#### Debilitating Barrage

Upon reaching 17th level, you’ve gained the knowledge to temporarily lower a creature’s fortitude by striking a series of pressure points. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can spend 3 ki points to cause the creature to suffer a vulnerability to a damage type of your choice for 1 minute, or until they take damage of that type. A creature who is affected by this feature cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.

#### Mystical Erudition (Additional)

You gain an additional language and an additional skill proficiency from the above list at 17th level. If you already have proficiency in one of the listed skills, you can instead choose to double your proficiency bonus for any ability check you make that uses the chosen proficiency.

## Way of the Open Hand
_Source: Player's Handbook_

Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.

#### Open Hand Technique
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy’s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:

-   It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked [[Conditions#Prone\|prone]].
-   It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.
-   It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.

#### Wholeness of Body
At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

#### Tranquility
Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a [sanctuary](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/sanctuary) spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.

#### Quivering Palm
At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone’s body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.

## Way of Shadow
_Source: Player's Handbook_


Monks of the Way of Shadow follow a tradition that values stealth and subterfuge. These monks might be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve as spies and assassins. Sometimes the members of a ninja monastery are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Other monasteries are more like thieves' guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else who can pay their fees. Regardless of their methods, the heads of these monasteries expect the unquestioning obedience of their students.

#### Shadow Arts
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can use your ki to duplicate the effects of certain spells. As an action, you can spend 2 ki points to cast [Darkness](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:darkness), [Darkvision](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:darkvision), [Pass without Trace](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:pass-without-trace), or [Silence](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:silence), without providing material components. Additionally, you gain the [Minor Illusion](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:minor-illusion) cantrip if you don't already know it.

#### Shadow Step
At 6th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of the turn.

#### Cloak of Shadows
By 11th level, you have learned to become one with the shadows. When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible. You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a spell, or are in an area of bright light.

#### Opportunist
At 17th level, you can exploit a creature's momentary distraction when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack made by a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature.

## Way of the Four Elements
_Source: Player's Handbook_

You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension of your body. Some members of this tradition dedicate themselves to a single element, but others weave the elements together.

Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of their ki powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants, mountains, and cresting waves.

#### Disciple of the Elements

When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements. A discipline requires you to spend ki points each time you use it.

You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and one other [elemental discipline](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/monk:four-elements:disciplines) of your choice. You learn one additional elemental discipline of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one elemental discipline that you already know with a different discipline.

**_Casting Elemental Spells._** Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material components for it.

Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as [Burning Hands](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:burning-hands) does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast [Burning Hands](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:burning-hands), you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline's base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).

The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table.

##### Spells and Ki Points
| Monk Levels | Maximum Ki Points for a Spell |
|:-----------:|:-----------------------------:|
|   5th-8th   |               3               |
|  9th-12th   |               4               |
|  13th-16th  |               5               |
|  17th-20th  |               6               |

# Rogue
Signaling for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the door open.

A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target — a notorious slaver — passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin’s blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.

Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and magically lifts the key ring from the guard’s belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape.

Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.

## Skill and Precision

Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.

When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.

## A Shady Living

Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves’ guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.

As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.

## Creating a Rogue

As you create your rogue character, consider the character’s relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past—or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves’ guild master? Or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?

What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend—another member of your adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.

> **QUICK BUILD**
> 
> You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability score. Make Intelligence your next-highest if you want to excel at Investigation or plan to take up the Arcane Trickster archetype. Choose Charisma instead if you plan to emphasize deception and social interaction. Second, choose the charlatan background.

## Class Features

As a rogue, you have the following class features.

#### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per rogue level  
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier  
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per rogue level after 1st

#### Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor  
**Weapons:** Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords  
**Tools:** Thieves’ tools  
**Saving Throws:** Dexterity, Intelligence  
**Skills:** Choose four from [Acrobatics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Acrobatics), [Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics), [Deception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Deception), [Insight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Insight), [Intimidation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Intimidation), [Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation), [Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception), [Performance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Performance), [Persuasion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Persuasion), [Sleight of Hand](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#SleightofHand), and [Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth)

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

-   (a) a rapier or (b) a shortsword
-   (a) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (b) a shortsword
-   (a) a burglar’s pack, (b) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (c) an explorer’s pack
-   Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves’ tools

#### Expertise

At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.

#### Sneak Attack

Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated), and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.

#### Thieves’ Cant

During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

#### Cunning Action

Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the [Dash](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dash), [Disengage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Disengage), or [Hide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Hide) action.

#### Roguish Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

#### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

#### Uncanny Dodge

Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.

#### Expertise

At 6th level, choose two more of your skill proficiencies, or one more of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

#### Evasion

Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as an [ancient red dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ancient-red-dragon)’s fiery breath or an [ice storm](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/ice-storm) spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

#### Reliable Talent

By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

#### Blindsense

Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or [invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible) creature within 10 feet of you.

#### Slippery Mind

By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

#### Elusive

Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated).

#### Stroke of Luck

At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Roguish Archetypes

Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.

## Thief

You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ.

#### Fast Hands

Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#SleightofHand)) check, use your thieves’ tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the [Use an Object](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#UseanObject) action.

#### Second-Story Work

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.

In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.

#### Supreme Sneak

Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity ([Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth)) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.

#### Use Magic Device

# Warlock
With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace sentinel to his will.

As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened human whispers the secret name of her demonic patron, infusing her spell with fiendish magic.

Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a distant world.

Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.

## Sworn and Beholden

A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron’s behalf.

The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock’s being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.

## Delvers into Secrets

Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well.

Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known. But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student’s mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.

Once a pact is made, a warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn’t intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.

## Creating a Warlock

As you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking about your patron and the obligations that your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the pact, and how did you make contact with your patron? Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you seek out the ritual that would allow you to make contact with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron, or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in anticipation of the rewards promised to you?

Work with your DM to determine how big a part your pact will play in your character’s adventuring career. Your patron’s demands might drive you into adventures, or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do between adventures.

What kind of relationship do you have with your patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? How important does your patron consider you to be? What part do you play in your patron’s plans? Do you know other servants of your patron?

How does your patron communicate with you? If you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with your patron’s voice. Some warlocks find messages from their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea leaves, or adrift in the clouds — messages that only the warlock can see. Other warlocks converse with their patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with intermediaries.

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

-   (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon
-   (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus
-   (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) a dungeoneer’s pack
-   Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers

#### Otherworldly Patron

At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice: the Fiend, which is detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

#### Pact Magic

Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. See [Spells Rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting "Spells Rules") for the general rules of spellcasting and the [Spells Listing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=7&filter-search=&filter-sub-class=&filter-concentration=&filter-ritual=&filter-unlocked-content= "Spells Listing (Warlock)") for the warlock spell list.

##### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.

##### Spell Slots

The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell [witch bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/witch-bolt), you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

##### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

##### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** \= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** \= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

##### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an arcane focus (see the [Adventuring Gear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus "Adventuring Gear") section) as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

#### Eldritch Invocations

In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.

On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell’s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.

##### Chains of Carceri

At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.

##### Pact of the Blade

You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see the [Weapons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Weapons) section for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

##### Pact of the Chain

You learn the [find familiar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/find-familiar) spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known.

When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: [imp](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/imp), [pseudodragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/pseudodragon), [quasit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/quasit), or [sprite](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/sprite).

Additionally, when you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack) action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack with its reaction.

##### Pact of the Tome

Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.

If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.

#### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

#### Mystic Arcanum (6th level)

At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

#### Mystic Arcanum (7th level)

At 13th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 7th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

#### Mystic Arcanum (8th level)

At 15th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 8th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At 17th level, you gain a 9th-level warlock spell of your choice that can be cast in this way. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

#### Mystic Arcanum (9th level)

At 17th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 9th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

#### Eldritch Master

At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

## Otherworldly Patrons

The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.

Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.

## The Fiend

You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz’Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.

#### Expanded Spell List

The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

##### Fiend Expanded Spells
| Spell Level | Spells |
|:-----------:| ------------- |
|     1st     | _[[Blur]], [[Silence]]_|
|     2nd     | _[[Create Food and Water]], [[Protection from Energy]]_| |
|     3rd     | _[[Fireball]], [[Stinking Cloud]]_| |
|     4th     | _[[Insect Plague\|insect plague]], [[Wall of Stone]]_| |
|     5th     | _[[Flame Strike\|insect plague]], [[Hallow]]_| |

#### Dark One’s Blessing

Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).

#### Dark One’s Own Luck

Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll’s effects occur.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Fiendish Resilience

Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.

#### Hurl Through Hell

Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.

At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

# D&D\D&D Rules\Creating a Character\Classes\Wizard.md

# Wizard
Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the battlefield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.

Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond.

Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left.

Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.

## Scholars of the Arcane

Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.

Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.

## The Lure of Knowledge

Wizards’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.

But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.

## Creating a Wizard

Creating a wizard character demands a backstory dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How did your character first come into contact with magic? How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic?

What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for more? Have you received word of a secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard? Perhaps you’re simply eager to put your newfound magical skills to the test in the face of danger.

> **QUICK BUILD**

## Class Features

As a wizard, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d6 per wizard level  
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution modifier  
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per wizard level after 1st

#### Proficiencies

**Armor:** None  
**Weapons:** Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows  
**Tools:** None  
**Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Wisdom  
**Skills:** Choose two from [[Ability Scores#Arcana|Arcana]], [[Ability Scores#History|History]], [[Ability Scores#Insight|Insight]], [[Ability Scores#Investigation|Investigation]], [[Ability Scores#Medicine|Medicine]], and [[Ability Scores#Medicine|Medicine]]

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

-   (a) a quarterstaff or (b) a dagger
-   (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus
-   (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack
-   A spellbook

#### Spellcasting

As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See [Spells Rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting "Spells Rules") for the general rules of spellcasting and the [Spells Listing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&filter-search=&filter-sub-class=&filter-concentration=&filter-ritual=&filter-unlocked-content= "Spells Listing (Wizard)") for the wizard spell list.

##### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.

##### Spellbook

At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell [[Magic Missile|magic missile]], you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

##### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** \= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** \= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

##### Ritual Casting

You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.

##### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an arcane focus (see the [Adventuring Gear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus "Adventuring Gear") section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

##### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher

Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).

> **YOUR SPELLBOOK**
> 
> The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.
> 
> **Copying a Spell into the Book.** When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
> 
> Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.
> 
> For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.
> 
> **Replacing the Book.** You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.
> 
> If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.
> 
> **The Book’s Appearance.** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.

#### Arcane Recovery

You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.

#### Arcane Tradition

When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. The School of Evocation is detailed at the end of the class description, and more choices are available in other sources.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

#### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

#### Spell Mastery

At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.

#### Signature Spells

When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

## Arcane Traditions

The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in the worlds of D&D, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.

The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools, as described in chapter 10. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.

## School of Evocation

You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.

#### Evocation Savant

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.

#### Sculpt Spells

Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

#### Potent Cantrip

Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

#### Empowered Evocation

Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.

#### Overchannel

Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.

# Armor and Shields
---

D&D worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor and shields used in the worlds of D&D.

**Armor Proficiency.** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.

**Armor Class (AC).** Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.

**Heavy Armor.** Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows "Str 13" or "Str 15" in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

**Stealth.** If the Armor table shows "Disadvantage" in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity ([[Ability Scores#Stealth|Stealth]]) checks.

**Shields.** A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

## Light Armor
---
| Armor Name      | Cost  |  Armor Class (AC)  | Strength |   Stealth    | Weight |
| --------------- |:-----:|:------------------:|:--------:|:------------:|:------:|
| Padded          | 5 gp  | 11 + DEX modifier  |    -     | Disadvantage | 8 lb.  |
| Leather         | 10 gp | 11 + DEX  modifier |    -     |      -       | 10 lb. |
| Studded leather | 45 gp | 12 + DEX modifier  |    -     |      -       | 13 lb. |

Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

**Padded.** Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.

**Leather.** The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.

**Studded Leather.** Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.

## Medium Armor
---
| Armor Name  |  Cost  |      Armor Class (AC)      | Strength |   Stealth    | Weight |
| ----------- |:------:|:--------------------------:|:--------:|:------------:|:------:|
| Hide        | 10 gp  | 12 + DEX modifier  (max 2) |    -     |      -       | 12 lb. |
| Chain shirt | 50 gp  | 13 + DEX  modifier (max 2) |    -     |      -       | 20 lb. |
| Scale mail  | 50 gp  | 14 + DEX modifier (max 2)  |    -     | Disadvantage | 45 lb. |
| Breastplate | 400 gp | 14 + DEX modifier (max 2)  |    -     |      -       | 20 lb. |
| Half plate  | 750 gp | 15 + DEX modifier (max 2)  |    -     | Disadvantage | 40 lb. |

Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

**Hide.** This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.

**Chain Shirt.** Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer's upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.

**Scale Mail.** This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.

**Breastplate.** This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer's vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.

**Half Plate.** Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer's body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.

## Heavy Armor
---
| Armor Name |  Cost   | Armor Class (AC) | Strength |   Stealth    | Weight |
| ---------- |:-------:|:----------------:|:--------:|:------------:|:------:|
| Ring mail  |  30 gp  |        14        |    -     | Disadvantage | 40 lb. |
| Chain mail |  75 gp  |        16        |  STR 13  | Disadvantage | 55 lb. |
| Splint     | 200 gp  |        17        |  STR 15  | Disadvantage | 60 lb. |
| Plate      | 1500 gp |        18        |  STR 15  | Disadvantage | 65 lb. |

Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.

Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn't penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

**Ring Mail.** This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can't afford better armor.

**Chain Mail.** Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.

**Splint.** This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.

**Plate.** Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.

## Shield
---
| Armor Name | Cost  | Armor Class (AC) | Strength | Stealth | Weight |
| ---------- |:-----:|:----------------:|:--------:|:-------:|:------:|
| Shield     | 10 gp |        +2        |    -     |    -    | 6 lb.  |

## Getting Into and Out of Armor
---
The time it takes to don or doff a type of armor or a shield is shown in the Donning and Doffing Armor table.

_**Don.**_ This is the time it takes to put on the item. You benefit from it's AC only if you take the full time to don it.

_**Doff.**_ This is the time it takes to take off the item. If you have help removing armor, reduce this time by half.

| Category     |    Don     |   Doff    |
| ------------ |:----------:|:---------:|
| Light Armor  |  1 minute  | 1 minute  |
| Medium Armor | 5 minutes  | 1 minute  |
| Heavy Armor  | 10 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Shield       |  1 action  | 1 action  |

>**VARIANT: EQUIPMENT SIZES**
>
>In most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that you find on your adventures, within the bounds of common sense. For example, a burly half-orc won’t fit in a halfling’s leather armor, and a gnome would be swallowed up in a cloud giant’s elegant robe.
>
>The DM can impose more realism. For example, a suit of plate armor made for one human might not fit another one without significant alterations, and a guard’s uniform might be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a disguise.
>
>Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing, and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need to visit an armorsmith, tailor, leatherworker, or similar expert to make the item wearable. The cost for such work varies from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item. The DM can either roll 1d4 × 10 or determine the increase in cost based on the extent of the alterations required.

# Magic Items
---
[Magic Items](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Magic%20in%20the%20Realms#h-Magic%20Items) are gleaned from the hoards of conquered [](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Empire%20of%20the%20Ghouls#h-Monsters)[](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ghosts%20of%20Saltmarsh#h-Monsters)[](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Xanathar%27s%20Guide%20to%20Everything#h-Monsters)[](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Monster%20Manual#h-Monsters)[](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Volo%27s%20Guide%20to%20Monsters#h-Monsters)[](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/BookIndex#h-Monsters)[](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Monsters#h-Monsters)[Monsters](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Monsters#h-Monsters) or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such items grant capabilities a character could rarely have otherwise, or they complement their owner’s capabilities in wondrous ways.

## Using a Magic Item

A magic item’s description explains how the item works. Handling a magic item is enough to give a character a sense that something is extraordinary about the item. The [identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/identify) spell is the fastest way to reveal an item’s properties. Alternatively, a character can focus on one magic item during a short rest, while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the character learns the item’s properties, as well as how to use them. Potions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the taster what the potion does.

## [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/magic-items#Attunement)Attunement

Some magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before their magical properties can be used. This bond is called **attunement**, and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. (If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster qualifies if it has spell slots and uses that class's spell list.) If the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or features, not using a magic item or the like.

Without becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits, unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.

Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can't be the same short rest used to learn the item's properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words.

An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an item first. Additionally, a creature can't attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can't attune to more than one [ring of protection](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/ring-of-protection) at a time.

A creature's attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed.

## [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/magic-items#WearingandWieldingItems)Wearing and Wielding Items

Using a magic item's properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held.

In most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer. Rare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that it doesn't adjust. For example, drow-made armor might fit elves only. Dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf-sized and dwarf-shaped folk.

When a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use your discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a creature with a snakelike tail instead of legs can't wear boots.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/magic-items#MultipleItemsoftheSameKind)Multiple Items of the Same Kind

Use common sense to determine whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A character can't normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, and one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character might be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for example, or to layer two cloaks.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/magic-items#PairedItems)Paired Items

Items that come in pairs—such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves—impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a [boot of striding and springing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/boots-of-striding-and-springing) on one foot and a [boot of elvenkind](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/boots-of-elvenkind) on the other foot gains no benefit from either.

## [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/magic-items#ActivatinganItem)Activating an Item

Activating some magic items requires a user to do something special, such as holding the item and uttering a command word. The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use the following rules for their activation.

If an item requires an action to activate, that action isn't a function of the [Use an Object](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#UseanObject) action, so a feature such as the rogue's Fast Hands can't be used to activate the item.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/magic-items#CommandWord)Command Word

A command word is a word or phrase that must be spoken for an item to work. A magic item that requires a command word can't be activated in an area where sound is prevented, as in the area of the [silence](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/silence) spell.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/magic-items#Consumables)Consumables

Some items are used up when they are activated. A potion or an elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/magic-items#Spells)Spells

Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell and caster level, doesn't expend any of the user's spell slots, and requires no components, unless the item's description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell's effects, with their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.

A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don't have a spellcasting ability -- perhaps you're a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature -- your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/magic-items#Charges)Charges

Some magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an [identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/identify) spell is cast on it, as well as when a creature attunes to it. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to it learns how many charges it regained.

# Weapons
---
Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A **melee weapon** is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a **ranged weapon** is used to attack a target at a distance.

## Weapon Proficiency

Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are **simple** and **martial**. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

## Weapon Properties

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

**Ammunition.** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield. ^e5642d

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons" later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

**Finesse.** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. ^2485aa

**Heavy.** Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively. ^128a24

**Light.** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. ^61dfbf

**Loading.** Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make. ^b73dd1

**Range.** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

**Reach.** This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it. ^6604df

**Special.** A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see "Special Weapons" later in this section).

**Thrown.** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property. ^5c0a1a

**Two-Handed.** This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it. ^9a257e

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property--the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack. ^e07a47

## Improvised Weapons

Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.

Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

## Silvered Weapons

Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.

## Special Weapons

^c6eebf

Weapons with special rules are described here.

**Lance.** You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.

**Net.** A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is [[Conditions#Restrained|restrained]] until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.

When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

-   **Heated Body.** A creature that touches the remorhaz or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.

## Actions

---

-   **Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ (6d10 + 7) piercing damage plus (3d6)fire damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the remorhaz can't bite another target
-   **Swallow.** The remorhaz makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite's damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the remorhaz, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the remorhaz's turns. If the remorhaz takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the remorhaz must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the remorhaz. If the remorhaz dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.

# D&D\D&D Rules\Playing The Game\Ability Scores.md

# Using Ability Scores
Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics:

-   **Strength**, measuring physical power
-   **Dexterity**, measuring agility
-   **Constitution**, measuring endurance
-   **Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory
-   **Wisdom**, measuring perception and insight
-   **Charisma**, measuring force of personality

Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities--a creature's assets as well as weaknesses. The three main rolls of the game -- the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll -- rely on the six ability scores. The [Introduction](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/introduction "Introduction") describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.

## Ability Scores and Modifiers

Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities related to that ability.

A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.

Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.

#### Ability Scores and Modifiers Table
| Score | Modifier |
|:-----:|:--------:|
|   1   |    -5    |
|  2-3  |    -4    |
|  4-5  |    -3    |
|  6-7  |    -2    |
|  8-9  |    -1    |
| 10-11 |    +0    |
| 12-13 |    +1    |
| 14-15 |    +2    |
| 16-17 |    +3    |
| 18-19 |    +4    |
| 20-21 |    +5    |
| 22-23 |    +6    |
| 24-25 |    +7    |
| 26-27 |    +8    |
| 28-29 |    +9    |
|  30   |   +10    |

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.

When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling's Lucky trait, lets you reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or replace only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The DM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.

## Proficiency Bonus

Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level, as detailed in "[Step-By-Step Characters](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters "Step-By-Step Characters")." Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.

Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.

Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.

By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.

In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.

## Ability Checks

An ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The DM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.

For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.

### Typical Difficulty Classes
|  Task Difficulty  | DC  |
|:-----------------:|:---:|
|     Very easy     |  5  |
|       Easy        | 10  |
|      Medium       | 15  |
|       Hard        | 20  |
|     Very hard     | 25  |
| Nearly impossible | 30  |

To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success--the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the DM.

### Contests

Sometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor.

This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal--for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.

Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.

### Skills

Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character's starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster's skill proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.)

For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.

The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability's description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.

**Strength**

-   Athletics

**Dexterity**

-   Acrobatics
-   Sleight of Hand
-   Stealth

**Intelligence**

-   Arcana
-   History
-   Investigation
-   Nature
-   Religion

**Wisdom**

-   Animal Handling
-   Insight
-   Medicine
-   Perception
-   Survival

**Charisma**

-   Deception
-   Intimidation
-   Performance
-   Persuasion

Sometimes, the DM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill--for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a player might ask the DM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.

For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the DM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.

#### Variant: Skills with Different Abilities

Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your DM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your DM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you're proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-‐‑orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your DM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.

### Passive Checks

A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the DM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.

Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:

**10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check**

If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a **score**.

For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.  
The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.

### Working Together

Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort--or the one with the highest ability modifier--can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.

A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves' tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another character in that task.

Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.

#### Group Checks

When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the DM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.

To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds.

Otherwise, the group fails. Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the DM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.

## Using Each Ability

Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.

### Strength

Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.

#### Strength Checks

A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.

##### Athletics

Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:

-   You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.
-   You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.
-   You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.

##### Other Strength Checks

The DM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door
-   Break free of bonds
-   Push through a tunnel that is too small
-   Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it
-   Tip over a statue
-   Keep a boulder from rolling

#### Strength Attack Rolls and Damage

You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.

#### Lifting and Carrying

Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.

**Carrying Capacity.** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don't usually have to worry about it.

**Push, Drag, or Lift.** You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.

**Size and Strength.** Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.

#### Variant: Encumbrance

The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.

If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are **encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.

If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead **heavily encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.

### Dexterity

Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.

#### Dexterity Checks

A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.

##### Acrobatics

Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

##### Sleight of Hand

Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.

##### Stealth

Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.

##### Other Dexterity Checks

The DM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent
-   Steer a chariot around a tight turn
-   Pick a lock
-   Disable a trap
-   Securely tie up a prisoner
-   Wriggle free of bonds
-   Play a stringed instrument
-   Craft a small or detailed object

#### Dexterity Attack Rolls and Damage

You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.

#### Armor Class

Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.

#### Initiative

At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures' turns in combat.

> **HIDING**
> 
> The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.
> 
> You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase. An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.
> 
> In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.
> 
> **Passive Perception.** When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.
> 
> **What Can You See?** One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be **lightly** or **heavily obscured**, as explained in [chapter 8](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/adventuring).

### Constitution

Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.

#### Constitution Checks

Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.

The DM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Hold your breath
-   March or labor for hours without rest
-   Go without sleep
-   Survive without food or water
-   Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go

#### Hit Points

Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.

If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you're 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.

### Intelligence

Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.

#### Intelligence Checks

An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.

##### Arcana

Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.

##### History

Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.

##### Investigation

When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

##### Nature

Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.

##### Religion

Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.

##### Other Intelligence Checks

The DM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Communicate with a creature without using words
-   Estimate the value of a precious item
-   Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard
-   Forge a document
-   Recall lore about a craft or trade
-   Win a game of skill

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.

### Wisdom

Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.

#### Wisdom Checks

A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone’s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.

##### Animal Handling

When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the DM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.

##### Insight

Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.

##### Medicine

A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.

##### Perception

Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.

> **FINDING A HIDDEN OBJECT**
> 
> When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.
> 
> In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the DM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.

##### Survival

The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.

##### Other Wisdom Checks

The DM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow
-   Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead

#### Spellcasting Ability

Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.

### Charisma

Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.

#### Charisma Checks

A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.

##### Deception

Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.

##### Intimidation

When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.

##### Performance

Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.

##### Persuasion

When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

##### Other Charisma Checks

The DM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip
-   Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation

#### Spellcasting Ability

Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.

## Saving Throws

A saving throw--also called a save--represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.

A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the DM.

Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.

The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.

A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to another plane of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.

If the target is native to the plane of existence you're on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is [[Conditions#Incapacitated|incapacitated]]. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one you're on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn't return.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.

Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.

If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

Your body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see you. For the duration, any creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn't rely on sight, as with [blindsight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Blindsight), or can see through illusions, as with [truesight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Truesight).

A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The spell fails if you can't see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can't accommodate the cloud).

When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.  
If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by 1d10.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.

You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is [[Conditions#Charmed|charmed]] by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The [[Conditions#Charmed|charmed]] creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was [[Conditions#Charmed|charmed]] by you.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog centered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured.

When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.

The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

You briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of the surrounding territory. In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn't function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.

You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:

-   terrain and bodies of water
-   prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples
-   powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead
-   influence from other planes of existence
-   buildings

  
For example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the location of any nearby towns.

A blast of cold air erupts from your hands. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by [[Wall of Force|wall of force]].

A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. The target is disintegrated if this damage leaves it with 0 hit points.

A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a [[True Resurrection|true resurrection]] or a [[Wish|wish]] spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot- cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.

Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell's level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.

Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god's servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.

The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.

If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.

A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you're casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.

|                 Knowledge                 | Save Modifier |
|:-----------------------------------------:|:-------------:|
| Secondhand (you have heard of the target) |      +5       |
|    Firsthand (you have met the target)    |       0       |
|    Familiar (you know the target well)    |      -5       |


|                    Connection                     | Save Modifier |
|:-------------------------------------------------:|:-------------:|
|                Likeness or picture                |      -2       |
|               Possession or garment               |      -4       |
| Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like |      -10      |

On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this spell against it again for 24 hours.

On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.

Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn't move.

A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell's effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that died for any reason except old age. If the creature's soul is free and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points.

This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs. If the creature was undead, it is restored to its non-undead form.

The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature's name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.

An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).

Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled by [[Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]. A [[Disintegrate|disintegrate]] spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.

**Wish** is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.

The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.

Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:

-   You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.
-   You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the _[[Greater Restoration|greater restoration]]_ spell.
-   You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.
-   You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.
-   You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a **wish** spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.

   
You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.

The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast **wish** ever again if you suffer this stress.

You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.

An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.

A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by [[Wall of Force|wall of force]].

A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. The target is disintegrated if this damage leaves it with 0 hit points.

A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a [[True Resurrection|true resurrection]] or a [[Wish|wish]] spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot- cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.

A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god's servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.

The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.

If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.

An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).

Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled by [[Dispel Magic|dispel magic]]. A [[Disintegrate|disintegrate]] spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.

You imbue a weapon you touch with holy power. Until the spell ends, the weapon emits bright light in a 30—foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an extra 2d8 radiant damage on a hit. If the weapon isn’t already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration. 

As a bonus action on your turn, you can dismiss this spell and cause the weapon to emit a burst of radiance. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the weapon must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 radiant damage, and it is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded. At the end of each of its turns, a blinded creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Pantheon of Aquarius

The Divine Gate, established during the Divergence, is a powerful barrier between the Material Plane and the divine realms. The Divine Gate sealed away both the Betrayer Gods and the Prime Deities within their respective domains in hopes of salvaging the new age and preventing another Calamity. If the Divine Gate were to be destroyed by the unanimous effort of the Prime Deities, all powers would be unleashed, threatening armageddon. Thus, the gods patiently watch their creations from beyond the veil, lending what small power they can send through the gate to aid the goals of their faithful. 

In the absence of the gods, lesser entities seek to gain power and influence, making pacts with mortals and offering their own gifts in exchange for favor, worship, or deeds done in their name.

The following gods, patrons, and titles are recommended as the existing pantheon, but they are only a recommendation. You are welcome to alter, supplement, or completely change the gods in your Wildemount campaign to fit your needs. The domains and pacts listed are the likely choices for clerics, warlocks, and followers of each entity, but these are not the only options, and many other domains can be attributed to your preferred deity. Talk with your DM about how best to dress your domain or pact choice to fit within the philosophies and commandments of your patron deity.

### Prime Deities

The circle of Prime Deities includes the leaders and luminary creators that battled the Primordials and instigated the Founding, forging the mortal races of Aquarius. They represent a spectrum of light, protection, love, death, and all other facets offreedom and life in the world. While some gods may disagree and squabble, they exist in a subtle alliance to maintain the sanctity of life and their respective creations.

You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](app://obsidian.md/Ability%20Scores#Perception)) check but can’t decipher it without magic.

#### Thieves’ Cant

During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

![[Aarakocra.jpg]]
# Aarakocra
Sequestered in high mountains atop tall trees, the aarakocra, sometimes called birdfolk, evoke fear and wonder. Many aarakocra aren’t even native to the Material Plane. They hail from a world beyond — from the boundless vistas of the Elemental Plane of Air.

They are immigrants, refugees, scouts, and explorers, their outposts functioning as footholds in a world both strange and alien.

## Beak and Feather
From below, aarakocra look much like large birds. Only when they descend to roost on a branch or walk across the ground does their humanoid appearance reveal itself. Standing upright, aarakocra might reach 5 feet tall, and they have long, narrow legs that taper to sharp talons.

Feathers cover their bodies. Their plumage typically denotes membership in a tribe. Males are brightly colored, with feathers of red, orange, or yellow. Females have more subdued colors, usually brown or gray. Their heads complete the avian appearance, being something like a parrot or eagle with distinct tribal variations.

## Sky Wardens
Nowhere are the aarakocra more comfortable than in the sky. They can spend hours in the air, and some go as long as days, locking their wings in place and letting the thermals hold them aloft. In battle, they prove dynamic and acrobatic fliers, moving with remarkable speed and grace, diving to lash opponents with weapons or talons before turning and flying away.

Once airborne, an aarakocra leaves the sky with reluctance. On their native plane, they can fly for days or months, landing only to lay their eggs and feed their young before launching themselves back into the air. Those that make it to a world in the Material Plane find it a strange place. They sometimes forget or ignore vertical distances, and they have nothing but pity for those earthbound people forced to live and toil on the ground.

## Avian Mannerisms
The resemblance of aarakocra to birds isn’t limited to physical features. Aarakocra display many of the same mannerisms as ordinary birds. They are fastidious about their plumage, frequently tending their feathers, cleaning and scratching away any tiny passengers they might have picked up. When they deign to descend from the sky, they often do so near pools where they can catch fish and bathe themselves.

Many aarakocra punctuate their speech with chirps, sounds they use to convey emphasis and to shade meaning, much as a human might through facial expressions and gestures. An aarakocra might become frustrated with people who fail to pick up on the nuances; an aarakocra’s threat might be taken as a jest and vice versa.

The idea of ownership baffles most aarakocra. After all, who owns the sky? Even when explained to them, they initially find the notion of ownership mystifying. As a result, aarakocra who have little interaction with other people might be a nuisance as they drop from the sky to snatch livestock or plunder harvests for fruits and grains. Shiny, glittering objects catch their eyes.

They find it hard not to pluck the treasure and bring it back to their settlement to beautify it. An aarakocra who spends years among other races can learn to inhibit these impulses.

Confinement terrifies the aarakocra. To be grounded, trapped underground, or imprisoned by the cold, unyielding earth is a torment few aarakocra can withstand. Even when perched on a high branch or at rest in their mountaintop homes, they appear alert, with eyes moving and bodies ready to take flight.

## Homelands
Most aarakocra live on the Elemental Plane of Air. Aarakocra can be drawn into the Material Plane, sometimes to pursue enemies or thwart their foes’ designs there. Accident might also send a nest of aarakocra tumbling into a world on that plane. A few find their way to such a world through portals on their own plane and establish nests in high mountains or in the canopies of old forests.

Once tribes of aarakocra settle in an area, they share a hunting territory that extends across an area up to 100 miles on a side, with each tribe hunting in the lands nearest to their colony, ranging farther should game become scarce.

A typical colony consists of one large, open-roofed nest made of woven vines. The eldest acts as leader with the support of a shaman. 

> **AARAKOCRA IN THE FORGOTTEN REALMS**
> 
> Never well established in Faerûn, aarakocra have only four major colonies: in the Star Mounts within the High Forest, in the Storm Horns in Cormyr, in the Cloven Mountains on the Vilhon Reach, and in the Mistcliffs in Chult.
> 
> Those colonies established in the Star Mounts, closest to the Dessarin Valley, were ever a secretive and guarded people, only spotted during their flights over the High Forest. A cruel and rapacious green dragon nearly wiped out the population and scattered the survivors. These aarakocra and their descendants have sworn vengeance against the dragon and may be seen scouring the lands of the North and Cormyr for signs of their foe.
> 
> Their only remaining settlement lies on the slopes of the Star Mounts’ southernmost mountains. At the headwaters of the Unicorn Run, the Last Aerie is home to several dozen aarakocra. Recently, aarakocra elders detected changes in the prevailing winds that they regarded as a bad omen.
> 
> Unlike the aarakocra of other worlds on the Material Plane, the aarakocra of the Realms rarely travel to the Elemental Plane of Air.

## Great Purpose
Aarakocra enjoy peace and solitude. Most of them have little interest in dealing with other peoples and less interest in spending time on the ground. For this reason, it takes an exceptional circumstance for an aarakocra to leave his or her tribe and undertake the adventurer’s life. Neither treasure nor glory is enough to lure them from their tribes; a dire threat to their people, a mission of vengeance, or a catastrophe typically lies at the heart of the aarakocra adventurer’s chosen path.

Two other circumstances might call an aarakocra to adventure. First, aarakocra have historical ties to the Wind Dukes of Aaqa. Exceptional individuals honor that connection and might seek out the missing pieces of the _Rod of Seven Parts_, the remains of an artifact fashioned by the Wind Dukes long ago to defeat the Queen of Chaos’s monstrous champion, Miska the Wolf-Spider.

When plunged into Miska’s body, the chaos in his blood sundered the rod and scattered its pieces across the multiverse. Recovering the pieces means gaining honor and esteem in the eyes of the vaati who forged it and could possibly restore a powerful weapon for defense against the agents of elemental evil.

Second, aarakocra are sworn foes of elemental earth, in particular the gargoyles that serve Ogrémoch, the Prince of Earth. The Aarakocra word for gargoyle is loosely translated as “flying rock,” and battles between aarakocra and gargoyles have raged across the Elemental Planes of Earth and Air, occasionally spilling into a world on the Material Plane. Aarakocra on that plane might leave their colonies to lend aid to other humanoids committed to fighting earth cults and thwarting their efforts.

## Aarakocra Names
As with much of their speech, aarakocra names include clicks, trills, and whistles to the point that other peoples have a difficult time pronouncing them. Typically, a name has two to four syllables with the sounds acting as connectors. When interacting with other races, aarakocra may use nicknames gained from people they meet or shortened forms of their full names.

An aarakocra of either gender may have one of these short names: Aera, Aial, Aur, Deekek, Errk, Heehk, Ikki, Kleeck, Oorr, Ouss, Quaf, Quierk, Salleek, Urreek, or Zeed. 

> **AARAKOCRA BACKGROUNDS**
> 
> Backgrounds that are most appropriate for aarakocra include the outlander, the hermit, and the sage.
> 
> The small colonies of aarakocra are insular and remote, and few aarakocra live away from their roosts. In the Star Mounts of the High Forest in the Forgotten Realms, no more than a few dozen aarakocra live away from the nests of their families. Those that do are usually rangers or fighters, constantly patrolling for outside threats.

## Aarakocra Traits
As an aarakocra, you have certain traits in common with your people. Being able to fly at high speed starting at 1st level is exceptionally effective in certain circumstances and exceedingly dangerous in others. As a result, playing an aarakocra requires special consideration by your DM.

#### Ability Score Increase
Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

#### Age
Aarakocra reach maturity by age 3. Compared to humans, aarakocra don’t usually live longer than 30 years.

#### Alignment
Most aarakocra are good and rarely choose sides when it comes to law and chaos. Tribal leaders and warriors might be lawful, while explorers and adventurers might tend toward chaotic.

#### Size
Aarakocra are about 5 feet tall. They have thin, lightweight bodies that weigh between 80 and 100 pounds. Your size is Medium.

#### Speed
Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

#### Flight
You have a flying speed of 50 feet. To use this speed, you can’t be wearing medium or heavy armor.

#### Talons
Your talons are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

#### Languages
You can speak, read, and write Common, Aarakocra, and Auran.

# Dragonborn
Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.

## Proud Dragon Kin

Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6½ feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.

The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some dragonborn clans. These dragonborn often boast scales that more closely match those of their dragon ancestor—bright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze.

## Self-Sufficient Clans

To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonborn’s conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.

A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency of the race as a whole. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn.

Though all dragonborn strive to be self\-sufficient, they recognize that help is sometimes needed in difficult situations. But the best source for such help is the clan, and when a clan needs help, it turns to another dragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races—or even from the gods.

## Dragonborn Names

Dragonborn have personal names given at birth, but they put their clan names first as a mark of honor. A childhood name or nickname is often used among clutchmates as a descriptive term or a term of endearment. The name might recall an event or center on a habit.

**Male Names:** Arjhan, Balasar, Bharash, Donaar, Ghesh, Heskan, Kriv, Medrash, Mehen, Nadarr, Pandjed, Patrin, Rhogar, Shamash, Shedinn, Tarhun, Torinn

**Female Names:** Akra, Biri, Daar, Farideh, Harann, Havilar, Jheri, Kava, Korinn, Mishann, Nala, Perra, Raiann, Sora, Surina, Thava, Uadjit

**Childhood Names:** Climber, Earbender, Leaper, Pious, Shieldbiter, Zealous

**Clan Names:** Clethtinthiallor, Daardendrian, Delmirev, Drachedandion, Fenkenkabradon, Kepeshkmolik, Kerrhylon, Kimbatuul, Linxakasendalor, Myastan, Nemmonis, Norixius, Ophinshtalajiir, Prexijandilin, Shestendeliath, Turnuroth, Verthisathurgiesh, Yarjerit

> **DRACONIANS**
> 
> In the Dragonlance setting, the followers of the evil goddess Takhisis learned a dark ritual that let them corrupt the eggs of metallic dragons, producing evil dragonborn called draconians. Five types of draconians, corresponding to the five types of metallic dragons, fought for Takhisis in the War of the Lance: auraks (gold), baaz (brass), bozak (bronze), kapak (copper), and sivak (silver). In place of their draconic breath weapons, they have unique magical abilities.

## Dragonborn Traits

Your draconic heritage manifests in a variety of traits you share with other dragonborn.

#### Ability Score Increase

Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.

#### Age

Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.

#### Alignment

Dragonborn tend to extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between good and evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). Most dragonborn are good, but those who side with Tiamat can be terrible villains.

#### Size

Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.

#### Speed

Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

#### Draconic Ancestry

You have draconic ancestry. Choose one type of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table. Your breath weapon and damage resistance are determined by the dragon type, as shown in the table.

**Draconic Ancestry**
(TABLE HERE)

#### Breath Weapon

You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

#### Damage Resistance

You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.

#### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.

# Dwarf
![The Dwarves](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/002/180/388/large/paul-mafayon-cover-les-nains.jpg?1458313160)

Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs—these common threads unite all dwarves.

## Short and Stout

Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.

Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.

![Ashes of Creation - Dwarven Village Outskirts](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/025/788/992/large/ryan-richmond-intrepidstudios-ryanrichmond-dwarvenarchitecture-04.jpg?1586926026)

## Long Memory, Long Grudges

Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.

Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don’t abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.

Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.

![Ruins of Tornar](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/018/343/179/large/mohammx-qureshi-1.jpg?1559032723)

## Clans and Kingdoms

Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can’t find in their mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.

The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.

Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.

![Koll, The Forgemaster](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/033/818/743/large/bram-sels-mtg-koll-the-forgemaster-bram-sels.jpg?1610643160)

## Gods, Gold, and Clan

Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure—for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are driven by the command or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago.  

> **SLOW TO TRUST**
> 
> Dwarves get along passably well with most other races. “The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a hundred years,” is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole, but certainly points to how difficult it can be for a member of a short-lived race like humans to earn a dwarf’s trust.
> 
> _**[[Elves]].**_ “It’s not wise to depend on the elves. No telling what an elf will do next; when the hammer meets the orc’s head, they’re as apt to start singing as to pull out a sword. They’re flighty and frivolous. Two things to be said for them, though: They don’t have many smiths, but the ones they have do very fine work. And when orcs or goblins come streaming down out of the mountains, an elf’s good to have at your back. Not as good as a dwarf, ma	ybe, but no doubt they hate the orcs as much as we do.”
> 
> _**[[Halflings]].**_ “Sure, they’re pleasant folk. But show me a halfling hero. An empire, a triumphant army. Even a treasure for the ages made by halfling hands. Nothing. How can you take them seriously?”
> 
> _**[[Humans]].**_ “You take the time to get to know a human, and by then the human’s on her deathbed. If you’re lucky, she’s got kin—a daughter or granddaughter, maybe—who’s got hands and heart as good as hers. That’s when you can make a human friend. And watch them go! They set their hearts on something, they’ll get it, whether it’s a dragon’s hoard or an empire’s throne. You have to admire that kind of dedication, even if it gets them in trouble more often than not.”
>
>_**[[Orcs]].**_ “The only pricks worse than elves...”

## Dwarf Names

A dwarf’s name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance with tradition. Every proper dwarven name has been used and reused down through the generations. A dwarf’s name belongs to the clan, not to the individual. A dwarf who misuses or brings shame to a clan name is stripped of the name and forbidden by law to use any dwarven name in its place.

> In cities deep in the Underdark live the duergar, or gray dwarves. These vicious, stealthy slave traders raid the surface world for captives, then sell their prey to the other races of the Underdark. They have innate magical abilities to become invisible and to temporarily grow to giant size.

![[Elf.png]]
# Elf
![Elves](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/002/131/294/large/veli-nystrom-elf-lieutenant.jpg?1457659150)

Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.

## Slender and Graceful
With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.

Elves’ coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.

![High Elves](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/012/896/259/large/maciej-kuciara-highelves-02.jpg?1537079375)

## A Timeless Perspective
Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.

Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.

## Hidden Woodland Realms
Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).

![Wood Elves](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/021/737/590/large/nico-navarro-final2-5.jpg?1572790488)

Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.

## Exploration and Adventure
Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.

>**HAUGHTY BUT GRACIOUS**
>
>Although they can be haughty, elves are generally gracious even to those who fall short of their high expectations—which is most non-elves. Still, they can find good in just about anyone.
>
>_**[[Dwarves]].**_ “Dwarves are dull, clumsy oafs. But what they lack in humor, sophistication, and manners, they make up in valor. And I must admit, their best smiths produce art that approaches elven quality.”
>
>_**[[Halflings]].**_ “Halflings are people of simple pleasures, and that is not a quality to scorn. They’re good folk, they care for each other and tend their gardens, and they have proven themselves tougher than they seem when the need arises.”
>
>_**[[Humans]].**_ “All that haste, their ambition and drive to accomplish something before their brief lives pass away—human endeavors seem so futile sometimes. But then you look at what they have accomplished, and you have to appreciate their achievements. If only they could slow down and learn some refinement.”
>
>_**[[Orcs]].**_ “No.”

## Elf Names
Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the hundredth birthday, and before this period they are called by child names.

On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a youngster might continue to use the child name. Each elf’s adult name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.

**Child Names:** Ara, Bryn, Del, Eryn, Faen, Innil, Lael, Mella, Naill, Naeris, Phann, Rael, Rinn, Sai, Syllin, Thia, Vall

**Male Adult Names:** Adran, Aelar, Aramil, Arannis, Aust, Beiro, Berrian, Carric, Enialis, Erdan, Erevan, Galinndan, Hadarai, Heian, Himo, Immeral, Ivellios, Laucian, Mindartis, Paelias, Peren, Quarion, Riardon, Rolen, Soveliss, Thamior, Tharivol, Theren, Varis

**Female Adult Names:** Adrie, Althaea, Anastrianna, Andraste, Antinua, Bethrynna, Birel, Caelynn, Drusilia, Enna, Felosial, Ielenia, Jelenneth, Keyleth, Leshanna, Lia, Meriele, Mialee, Naivara, Quelenna, Quillathe, Sariel, Shanairra, Shava, Silaqui, Theirastra, Thia, Vadania, Valanthe, Xanaphia

**Family Names (Common Translations):** Amakiir (Gemflower), Amastacia (Starflower), Galanodel (Moonwhisper), Holimion (Diamonddew), Ilphelkiir (Gemblossom), Liadon (Silverfrond), Meliamne (Oakenheel), Naïlo (Nightbreeze), Siannodel (Moonbrook), Xiloscient (Goldpetal)

![City of the Gondolindrim](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/036/825/980/large/pete-amachree-city-of-the-gondolindrim.jpg?1618742060)

## Elf Traits	
Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.

#### Ability Score Increase
Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

#### Age
Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.

#### Alignment
Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.

#### Size
Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

#### Speed
Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

#### Darkvision
Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

#### Keen Senses
You have proficiency in the [[Ability Scores#Perception|Perception]] skill.

#### Fey Ancestry
You have advantage on saving throws against being [[Conditions#Charmed|charmed]], and magic can’t put you to sleep.

#### Trance
Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

#### Languages
You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.

## Subrace
Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. Choose one of the two subraces presented below or one from another source. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.

### High Elf
*Source: Player's Handbook*

![](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/002/396/548/large/veli-nystrom-mountain-elf2.jpg?1461239289)

As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk, the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.

The sun elves of Faerûn (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.

#### Ability Score Increase
Your Intelligence score increases by 1.

#### Elf Weapon Training
You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

#### Cantrip
You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.

#### Extra Language
You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.

### Wood Elf
*Source: Player's Handbook*

![HoMM3 Remake : Wood Elf](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/037/011/928/large/mark-tarrisse-elf-002ef.jpg?1619221605)

As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through your native forests. This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerûn, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.

Wood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.

#### Ability Score Increase
Your Wisdom score increases by 1.

#### Elf Weapon Training
You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

#### Fleet of Foot
Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.

#### Mask of the Wild
You can attempt to [hide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Hide) even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.

### Dark Elf (Drow)
*Source: Player's Handbook*

![Drow picnic](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/006/582/348/large/martin-sobr-drowweb.jpg?1499701854)

Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned elves, the drow were banished from the surface world for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. Now they have built their own civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of Lolth. Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.

Drow adventurers are rare, and the race does not exist in all worlds. Check with your Dungeon Master to see if you can play a drow character.

#### Ability Score Increase
Your Charisma score increases by 1.

#### Superior Darkvision
Your darkvision has a range of 120 feet, instead of 60.

#### Sunlight Sensitivity
You have disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of the attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.

#### Drow Magic
You know the [Dancing Lights](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:dancing-lights) cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the [Faerie Fire](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:faerie-fire) spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the [[Darkness]] spell onceand regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

#### Drow Weapon Training
You have proficiency with rapiers, shortswords, and hand crossbows.

>**THE DARKNESS OF THE DROW**
>
>Were it not for one renowned exception, the race of drow would be universally reviled. To most, they are a race of demon-worshiping marauders dwelling in the subterranean depths of the Underdark, emerging only on the blackest nights to pillage and slaughter the surface dwellers they despise. Their society is depraved and preoccupied with the favor of Lolth, their spider-goddess, who sanctions murder and the extermination of entire families as noble houses vie for position.
>
>Yet one drow, at least, broke the mold. In the world of the Forgotten Realms, Drizzt Do’Urden, ranger of the North, has proven his quality as a good-hearted defender of the weak and innocent. Rejecting his heritage and adrift in a world that looks upon him with terror and loathing, Drizzt is a model for those few drow who follow in his footsteps, trying to find a life apart from the evil society of their Underdark homes.
>
> Drow grow up believing that surface-dwelling races are inferior, worthless except as slaves. Drow who develop a conscience or find it necessary to cooperate with members of other races find it hard to overcome that prejudice, especially when they are so often on the receiving end of hatred.


### Eladrin (Variant)
*Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes*

![Commission: Eladrin Elf : Autumn, Winter, Spring, Summer](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/026/696/500/large/david-baldridge-groupimage.jpg?1589469422)

_This version of the eladrin originally appeared in the Dungeon Master's Guide as an example for creating your own subraces._

Creatures of magic with strong ties to nature, eladrin live in the twilight realm of the Feywild. Their cities sometimes cross over to the Material Plane, appearing briefly in mountain valleys or deep forest glades before fading back into the Feywild.

#### Ability Score Increase
Your Intelligence score increases by 1.

#### Elf Weapon Training
You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

#### Fey Step

![[Genasi.png]]
# Genasi
Those who think of other planes at all consider them remote, distant realms, but planar influence can be felt throughout the world. It sometimes manifests in beings who, through an accident of birth, carry the power of the planes in their blood. The genasi are one such people, the offspring of genies and mortals.

The Elemental Planes are often inhospitable to natives of the Material Plane: crushing earth, searing flames, boundless skies, and endless seas make visiting these places dangerous for even a short time. The powerful genies, however, don’t face such troubles when venturing into the mortal world. They adapt well to the mingled elements of the Material Plane, and they sometimes visit—whether of their own volition or compelled by magic. Some genies can adopt mortal guise and travel incognito.

During these visits, a mortal might catch a genie’s eye. Friendship forms, romance blooms, and sometimes children result. These children are genasi: individuals with ties to two worlds, yet belonging to neither. Some genasi are born of mortal–genie unions, others have two genasi as parents, and a rare few have a genie further up their family tree, manifesting an elemental heritage that’s lain dormant for generations.

Occasionally, genasi result from exposure to a surge of elemental power, through phenomena such as an eruption from the Inner Planes or a planar convergence. Elemental energy saturates any creatures in the area and might alter their nature enough that their offspring with other mortals are born as genasi.

## Heirs to Elemental Power
Genasi inherit something from both sides of their dual nature. They resemble humans but have unusual skin color (red, green, blue, or gray), and there is something odd about them. The elemental blood flowing through their veins manifests differently in each genasi, often as magical power.

Seen in silhouette, a genasi can usually pass for human. Those of earth or water descent tend to be heavier, while those of air or fire tend to be lighter. A given genasi might have some features reminiscent of the mortal parent (pointed ears from an elf, a stockier frame and thick hair from a dwarf, small hands and feet from a halfling, exceedingly large eyes from a gnome, and so on).

Genasi almost never have contact with their elemental parents. Genies seldom have interest in their mortal offspring, seeing them as accidents. Many feel nothing for their genasi children at all.

Some genasi live as outcasts, driven into exile for their unsettling appearance and strange magic, or assuming leadership of savage humanoids and weird cults in untamed lands. Others gain positions of great influence, especially where elemental beings are revered. A few genasi leave the Material Plane to find refuge in the households of their genie parents.

## Wild and Confident
Genasi rarely lack confidence, seeing themselves as equal to almost any challenge in their path. This certainty might manifest as graceful self-assurance in one genasi and as arrogance in another. Such self- confidence can sometimes blind genasi to risk, and their great plans often get them and others into trouble.

Too much failure can chip away at even a genasi’s sense of self, so they constantly push themselves to improve, honing their talents and perfecting their craft.

## Genasi Lands
As rare beings, genasi might go their entire lives without encountering another one of their kind. There are no great genasi cities or empires. Genasi seldom have communities of their own and typically adopt the cultures and societies into which they are born. The more strange their appearance, the harder time they have. Many genasi lose themselves in teeming cities, where their distinctiveness hardly raises an eyebrow in places accustomed to a variety of different people.

> **GENASI ON ATHAS**
> 
> Although any world that includes one or more elemental planes can feature genasi, on Athas, the world of the Dark Sun campaign setting, elemental forces hold greater sway than they do on other worlds. As a people touched by elemental power, genasi are viewed as seers, prophets, and chosen ones. The birth of a genasi, whether a slave, a noble, or a member of a desert tribe, is an auspicious event. Most Athasians believe a given genasi is destined for greatness—or infamy.

Those living on the frontier, though, have a much harder time. People there tend to be less accepting of differences. Sometimes a cold shoulder and a suspicious glare are the best genasi can hope for; in more backward places, they face ostracism and even violence from people who mistake them for fiends.

Facing a hard life, these genasi seek isolation in the wilds, making their homes in mountains or forests, near lakes, or underground.

Most air and fire genasi in the Realms are descendants of the djinn and efreet who once ruled Calimshan. When those rulers were overthrown, their planetouched children were scattered. Over thousands of years, the bloodlines of those genasi have spread into other lands. Though far from common, air and fire genasi are more likely to be found in the western regions of Faerûn, along the coast from Calimshan north up to the Sword Coast, and into the Western Heartlands to the east. Some remain in their ancient homeland.

In contrast, water and earth genasi have no common history. Individuals have difficulty tracing their own lineage, and bloodlines occasionally skip a generation or two. Many earth genasi originated in the North and spread out from there. Water genasi come from coastal areas, the largest concentration of them hailing from the regions surrounding the Sea of Fallen Stars.

The distant land of Zakhara is known only in legends to most inhabitants of Faerûn. There, genies and spellcasters enter into bargains, and genasi can result from such pacts. Those genasi have been sources of great weal and woe in the history of that land.

> **GENASI BACKGROUNDS**
> 
> Each genasi subrace has its own temperament, which might make some backgrounds more suitable than others.
> 
> Air genasi are proud of their heritage, sometimes to the point of haughtiness. They can be flamboyant, and are keen to have an audience. They rarely stay in one place for long, always looking for a new sky to see and breathe. Air genasi who don’t live in cities favor open lands such as plains, deserts, and high mountains. Fitting backgrounds include charlatan, entertainer, and noble.
> 
> Earth genasi are more withdrawn, and their connection to the earth keeps them from being comfortable in most cities. Their uncommon size and strength makes them natural soldiers, though, and with their stoic demeanor, they can encourage others and become great leaders. Many earth genasi live underground, where they can be in their favored element. When they emerge from their caves, they might roam the hills and mountains or lay claim to old ruins.
> 
> Appropriate backgrounds for earth genasi include hermit, outlander, and soldier.
> 
> Fire genasi often get themselves into difficulty with their fiery tempers. Like their air genasi cousins, they sometimes flaunt their perceived superiority over common folk. But they also want others to share their high opinion of themselves, so they constantly seek to enhance their reputations.
> 
> Likely backgrounds for a fire genasi include criminal, folk hero, and noble.
> 
> Water genasi almost all have some experience aboard or around sea vessels. They make excellent mariners and fishers. Like earth genasi, though, water genasi prefer quiet and solitude; the wide shores are their natural homes. They go where they want, do what they want, and rarely feel bound to anything. Good backgrounds for water genasi include hermit and sailor.

## Genasi Names
Genasi use the naming conventions of the people among whom they were raised. They might later assume distinctive names to capture their heritage, such as Flame, Ember, Wave, or Onyx.

### Subraces
Four major subraces of genasi are found among the worlds of D&D: air genasi, earth genasi, fire genasi, and water genasi. Choose one of these subraces.

## Genasi Traits
Your genasi character has certain characteristics in common with all other genasi.

#### Languages
You can speak, read, and write Common and Primordial. Primordial is a guttural language, filled with harsh syllables and hard consonants.

#### Ability Score Increase
Your Constitution score increases by 2.

#### Age
Genasi mature at about the same rate as humans and reach adulthood in their late teens. They live somewhat longer than humans do, up to 120 years.

#### Alignment
Independent and self-reliant, genasi tend toward a neutral alignment.

#### Size
Genasi are as varied as their mortal parents but are generally built like humans, standing anywhere from 5 feet to over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.

#### Speed
Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

### Air Genasi
As an air genasi, you are descended from the djinn. As changeable as the weather, your moods shift from calm to wild and violent with little warning, but these storms rarely last long.

Air genasi typically have light blue skin, hair, and eyes. A faint but constant breeze accompanies them, tousling the hair and stirring the clothing. Some air genasi speak with breathy voices, marked by a faint echo. A few display odd patterns in their flesh or grow crystals from their scalps.

#### Ability Score Increase
Your Dexterity score increases by 1.

#### Unending Breath
You can hold your breath indefinitely while you’re not [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated).

#### Mingle with the Wind
You can cast the [levitate](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/levitate) spell once with this trait, requiring no material components, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

### Earth Genasi
As an earth genasi, you are descended from the cruel and greedy dao, though you aren’t necessarily evil. You have inherited some measure of control over earth, reveling in superior strength and solid power. You tend to avoid rash decisions, pausing long enough to consider your options before taking action.

Elemental earth manifests differently from one individual to the next. Some earth genasi always have bits of dust falling from their bodies and mud clinging to their clothes, never getting clean no matter how often they bathe. Others are as shiny and polished as gemstones, with skin tones of deep brown or black, eyes sparkling like agates. Earth genasi can also have smooth metallic flesh, dull iron skin spotted with rust, a pebbled and rough hide, or even a coating of tiny embedded crystals. The most arresting have fissures in their flesh, from which faint light shines.

#### Ability Score Increase
Your Strength score increases by 1.

#### Earth Walk
You can move across difficult terrain made of earth or stone without expending extra movement.

#### Merge with Stone
You can cast the [pass without trace](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/pass-without-trace) spell once with this trait, requiring no material components, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

### Fire Genasi
As a fire genasi, you have inherited the volatile mood and keen mind of the efreet. You tend toward impatience and making snap judgments. Rather than hide your distinctive appearance, you exult in it.

Nearly all fire genasi are feverishly hot as if burning inside, an impression reinforced by flaming red, coal- black, or ash-gray skin tones. The more human-looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion, while more exotic specimens sport actual flames dancing on their heads. Fire genasi voices might sound like crackling flames, and their eyes flare when angered. Some are accompanied by the faint scent of brimstone.

#### Ability Score Increase
Your Intelligence score increases by 1.

#### Darkvision
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. Your ties to the Elemental Plane of Fire make your [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision) unusual: everything you see in darkness is in a shade of red.

#### Fire Resistance
You have resistance to fire damage.

![[Gnome.png]]
# Gnome
A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.

## Vibrant Expression

A gnome’s energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the gnome’s insatiable interest in everything around.

A gnome’s personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male gnome’s beard, in contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnome’s clothing, though usually made in modest earth tones, is elaborately decorated with embroidery, embossing, or gleaming jewels.

## Delighted Dedication

As far as gnomes are concerned, being alive is a wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life. Humans might wonder about getting bored over the course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time to savor the beauties of the world in their long years, but gnomes seem to worry that even with all that time, they can’t get in enough of the things they want to do and see.

Gnomes speak as if they can’t get the thoughts out of their heads fast enough. Even as they offer ideas and opinions on a range of subjects, they still manage to listen carefully to others, adding the appropriate exclamations of surprise and appreciation along the way.

Though gnomes love jokes of all kinds, particularly puns and pranks, they’re just as dedicated to the more serious tasks they undertake. Many gnomes are skilled engineers, alchemists, tinkers, and inventors. They’re willing to make mistakes and laugh at themselves in the process of perfecting what they do, taking bold (sometimes foolhardy) risks and dreaming large.

## Bright Burrows

Gnomes make their homes in hilly, wooded lands. They live underground but get more fresh air than dwarves do, enjoying the natural, living world on the surface whenever they can. Their homes are well hidden by both clever construction and simple illusions. Welcome visitors are quickly ushered into the bright, warm burrows. Those who are not welcome are unlikely to find the burrows in the first place.

Gnomes who settle in human lands are commonly gemcutters, engineers, sages, or tinkers. Some human families retain gnome tutors, ensuring that their pupils enjoy a mix of serious learning and delighted enjoyment. A gnome might tutor several generations of a single human family over the course of his or her long life.

## Gnome Names

Gnomes love names, and most have half a dozen or so. A gnome’s mother, father, clan elder, aunts, and uncles each give the gnome a name, and various nicknames from just about everyone else might or might not stick over time. Gnome names are typically variants on the names of ancestors or distant relatives, though some are purely new inventions. When dealing with humans and others who are “stuffy” about names, a gnome learns to use no more than three names: a personal name, a clan name, and a nickname, choosing the one in each category that’s the most fun to say.

**Male Names:** Alston, Alvyn, Boddynock, Brocc, Burgell, Dimble, Eldon, Erky, Fonkin, Frug, Gerbo, Gimble, Glim, Jebeddo, Kellen, Namfoodle, Orryn, Roondar, Seebo, Sindri, Warryn, Wrenn, Zook

**Female Names:** Bimpnottin, Breena, Caramip, Carlin, Donella, Duvamil, Ella, Ellyjobell, Ellywick, Lilli, Loopmottin, Lorilla, Mardnab, Nissa, Nyx, Oda, Orla, Roywyn, Shamil, Tana, Waywocket, Zanna

**Clan Names:** Beren, Daergel, Folkor, Garrick, Nackle, Murnig, Ningel, Raulnor, Scheppen, Timbers, Turen

**Nicknames:** Aleslosh, Ashhearth, Badger, Cloak, Doublelock, Filchbatter, Fnipper, Ku, Nim, Oneshoe, Pock, Sparklegem, Stumbleduck

## Seeing the World

Curious and impulsive, gnomes might take up adventuring as a way to see the world or for the love of exploring. As lovers of gems and other fine items, some gnomes take to adventuring as a quick, if dangerous, path to wealth. Regardless of what spurs them to adventure, gnomes who adopt this way of life eke as much enjoyment out of it as they do out of any other activity they undertake, sometimes to the great annoyance of their adventuring companions.

> **ALWAYS APPRECIATIVE**
> 
> It’s rare for a gnome to be hostile or malicious unless he or she has suffered a grievous injury. Gnomes know that most races don’t share their sense of humor, but they enjoy anyone’s company just as they enjoy everything else they set out to do.

## Subrace

Choose one of the subraces below or one from another source.

> **DEEP GNOMES**
> 
> A third subrace of gnomes, the deep gnomes (or svirfneblin), live in small communities scattered in the Underdark. Unlike the duergar and the drow, svirfneblin are as good as their surface cousins. However, their humor and enthusiasm are dampened by their oppressive environment, and their inventive expertise is directed mostly toward stonework.

## Gnome Traits

Your gnome character has certain characteristics in common with all other gnomes.

#### Ability Score Increase

Your Intelligence score increases by 2.

#### Age

Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do, and most are expected to settle down into an adult life by around age 40. They can live 350 to almost 500 years.

#### Alignment

Gnomes are most often good. Those who tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers, scholars, investigators, or inventors. Those who tend toward chaos are minstrels, tricksters, wanderers, or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes are good-hearted, and even the tricksters among them are more playful than vicious.

#### Size

Gnomes are between 3 and 4 feet tall and average about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.

#### Speed

Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

#### Darkvision

Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

#### Gnome Cunning

You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.

#### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish. The Gnomish language, which uses the Dwarvish script, is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world.

### Deep Gnome

Forest gnomes and rock gnomes are the gnomes most commonly encountered in the lands of the surface world. There is another subrace of gnomes rarely seen by any surface-dweller: deep gnomes, also known as svirfneblin. Guarded, and suspicious of outsiders, svirfneblin are cunning and taciturn, but can be just as kind-hearted, loyal, and compassionate as their surface cousins.

When you create a gnome character, you may choose the deep gnome as an alternative to the subraces in the _Player’s Handbook_.

#### Ability Score Increase

Your Dexterity score increases by 1.

#### Age

Deep gnomes are short-lived for gnomes. They mature at the same rate humans do and are considered full-grown adults by 25. They live 200 to 250 years, although hard toil and the dangers of the Underdark often claim them before their time.

#### Alignment

Svirfneblin believe that survival depends on avoiding entanglements with other creatures and not making enemies, so they favor neutral alignments. They rarely wish others ill, and they are unlikely to take risks on behalf of others.

#### Size

A typical svirfneblin stands about 3 to 3½ feet tall and weighs 80 to 120 pounds. Your size is Small.

#### Superior Darkvision

Your darkvision has a radius of 120 feet.

#### Stone Camouflage

You have advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth)) checks to hide in rocky terrain.

#### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common, Gnomish, and Undercommon. The svirfneblin dialect is more guttural than surface Gnomish, and most svirfneblin know only a little bit of Common, but those who deal with outsiders (and that includes you as an adventurer) pick up enough Common to get by in other lands.

### Rock Gnome

As a rock gnome, you have a natural inventiveness and hardiness beyond that of other gnomes. Most gnomes in the worlds of D&D are rock gnomes, including the tinker gnomes of the Dragonlance setting.

#### Ability Score Increase

Your Constitution score increases by 1.

#### Artificer’s Lore

Whenever you make an Intelligence ([History](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#History)) check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you normally apply.

#### Tinker

You have proficiency with artisan’s tools (tinker’s tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time.

When you create a device, choose one of the following options:

_Clockwork Toy._ This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.

_Fire Starter._ The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.

_Music Box._ When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume.  
The box stops playing when it reaches the song’s end or when it is closed.

# D&D\Enciclopédia\Fauna, Flora & Materials\Races\Goliaths.md

# Goliath
At the highest mountain peaks — far above the slopes where trees grow and where the air is thin and the frigid winds howl — dwell the reclusive goliaths. Few folk can claim to have seen a goliath, and fewer still can claim friendship with them. Goliaths wander a bleak realm of rock, wind, and cold. Their bodies look as if they are carved from mountain stone and give them great physical power. Their spirits take after the wandering wind, making them nomads who wander from peak to peak. Their hearts are infused with the cold regard of their frigid realm, leaving each goliath with the responsibility to earn a place in the tribe or die trying.

## Driven Competitors

Every day brings a new challenge to a goliath. Food, water, and shelter are rare in the uppermost mountain reaches. A single mistake can bring doom to an entire tribe, while an individual’s heroic effort can ensure the entire group’s survival.

Goliaths thus place a premium on self-sufficiency and individual skill. They have a compulsion to keep score, counting their deeds and tallying their accomplishments to compare to others. Goliaths love to win, but they see defeat as a prod to improve their skills.

This dedication to competition has a dark side. Goliaths are ferocious competitors, but above all else they are driven to outdo their past efforts. If a goliath slays a dragon, he or she might seek out a larger, more powerful wyrm to battle. Few goliath adventurers reach old age, as most die attempting to surpass their past accomplishments.

## Fair Play

For goliaths, competition exists only when it is supported by a level playing field. Competition measures talent, dedication, and effort. Those factors determine survival in their home territory, not reliance on magic items, money, or other elements that can tip the balance one way or the other. Goliaths happily rely on such benefits, but they are careful to remember that such an advantage can always be lost. A goliath who relies too much on them can grow complacent, a recipe for disaster in the mountains.

This trait manifests most strongly when goliaths interact with other folk. The relationship between peasants and nobles puzzles goliaths. If a king lacks the intelligence or leadership to lead, then clearly the most talented person in the kingdom should take his place. Goliaths rarely keep such opinions to themselves, and mock folk who rely on society’s structures or rules to maintain power.

## Survival of the Fittest

Among goliaths, any adult who can’t contribute to the tribe is expelled. A lone goliath has little chance of survival, especially an older or weaker one. Goliaths have little pity for adults who can’t take care of themselves, though a sick or injured individual is treated, as a result of the goliath concept of fair play.

A permanently injured goliath is still expected to pull his or her weight in the tribe. Typically, such a goliath dies attempting to keep up, or the goliath slips away in the night to seek the cold will of fate.

In some ways, the goliath drive to outdo themselves feeds into the grim inevitability of their decline and death. A goliath would much rather die in battle, at the peak of strength and skill, than endure the slow decay of old age. Few folk have ever meet an elderly goliath, and even those goliaths who have left their people grapple with the urge to give up their lives as their physical skills decay.

Because of their risk-taking, goliath tribes suffer from a chronic lack of the experience offered by long- term leaders. They hope for innate wisdom in their leadership, for they can rarely count on a wisdom grown with age.

## Goliath Names

Every goliath has three names: a birth name assigned by the newborn’s mother and father, a nickname assigned by the tribal chief, and a family or clan name. A birth name is up to three syllables long. Clan names are five syllables or more and end in a vowel.

Birth names are rarely linked to gender. Goliaths see females and males as equal in all things, and they find societies with roles divided by gender to be puzzling or worthy of mockery. To a goliath, the person who is best at a job should be the one tasked with doing it.

A goliath’s nickname is a description that can change on the whim of a chieftain or tribal elder. It refers to a notable deed, either a success or failure, committed by the goliath. Goliaths assign and use nicknames with their friends of other races, and change them to refer to an individual’s notable deeds.

Goliaths present all three names when identifying themselves, in the order of birth name, nickname, and clan name. In casual conversation, they use their nickname.

**Birth Names:** Aukan, Eglath, Gae-Al, Gauthak, Ilikan, Keothi, Kuori, Lo-Kag, Manneo, Maveith, Nalla, Orilo, Paavu, Pethani, Thalai, Thotham, Uthal, Vaunea, Vimak

**Nicknames:** Bearkiller, Dawncaller, Fearless, Flintfinder, Horncarver, Keeneye, Lonehunter, Longleaper, Rootsmasher, Skywatcher, Steadyhand, Threadtwister, Twice-Orphaned, Twistedlimb, Wordpainter

**Clan Names:** Anakalathai, Elanithino, Gathakanathi, Kalagiano, Katho-Olavi, Kolae-Gileana, Ogolakanu, Thuliaga, Thunukalathi, Vaimei-Laga

## Goliath Traits

Goliaths share a number of traits in common with each other.

#### Ability Score Increase

Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

#### Age

Goliaths have lifespans comparable to humans. They enter adulthood in their late teens and usually live less than a century.

#### Alignment

Goliath society, with its clear roles and tasks, has a strong lawful bent. The goliath sense of fairness, balanced with an emphasis on self- sufficiency and personal accountability, pushes them toward neutrality.

#### Size

Goliaths are between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 280 and 340 pounds. Your size is Medium.

#### Speed

Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

#### Natural Athlete

You have proficiency in the [Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics) skill.

#### Stone’s Endurance

You can focus yourself to occasionally shrug off injury. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled and reduce the damage by that total. After you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Powerful Build

You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

#### Mountain Born

You have resistance to cold damage. You’re also acclimated to high altitude, including elevations above 20,000 feet.

#### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Giant.

# D&D\Enciclopédia\Fauna, Flora & Materials\Races\Half-Elves.md

# Half-Elf
Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches them. Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.

## Of Two Worlds
To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, they look human. In height, they’re on par with both parents, though they’re neither as slender as elves nor as broad as humans. They range from under 5 feet to about 6 feet tall, and from 100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly taller and heavier than women. Half-elf men do have facial hair, and sometimes grow beards to mask their elven ancestry. Half-elven coloration and features lie somewhere between their human and elf parents, and thus show a variety even more pronounced than that found among either race. They tend to have the eyes of their elven parents.

## Diplomats or Wanderers
Half-elves have no lands of their own, though they are welcome in human cities and somewhat less welcome in elven forests. In large cities in regions where elves and humans interact often, half-elves are sometimes numerous enough to form small communities of their own. They enjoy the company of other half-elves, the only people who truly understand what it is to live between these two worlds.

In most parts of the world, though, half-elves are uncommon enough that one might live for years without meeting another. Some half-elves prefer to avoid company altogether, wandering the wilds as trappers, foresters, hunters, or adventurers and visiting civilization only rarely. Like elves, they are driven by the wanderlust that comes of their longevity. Others, in contrast, throw themselves into the thick of society, putting their charisma and social skills to great use in diplomatic roles or as swindlers.

## Half-Elf Names
Half-elves use either human or elven naming conventions. As if to emphasize that they don’t really fit in to either society, half-elves raised among humans are often given elven names, and those raised among elves often take human names.

> **EXCELLENT AMBASSADORS**
> 
> Many half-elves learn at an early age to get along with everyone, defusing hostility and finding common ground. As a race, they have elven grace without elven aloofness and human energy without human boorishness. They often make excellent ambassadors and go-betweens (except between elves and humans, since each side suspects the half-elf of favoring the other).

## Half-Elf Variants
Some half-elves in Faerûn have a racial trait in place of the Skill Versatility trait. If your DM allows it, your half-elf character can forgo Skill Versatility and instead take the elf trait Keen Senses or a trait based on your elf parentage:

## Half-Elf Traits
Your half-elf character has some qualities in common with elves and some that are unique to half-elves.

#### Ability Score Increase
Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.

#### Age
Half-elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years.

#### Alignment
Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their elven heritage. They value both personal freedom and creative expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for followers. They chafe at rules, resent others’ demands, and sometimes prove unreliable, or at least unpredictable.

#### Size
Half-elves are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.

#### Speed
Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

#### Darkvision
Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

#### Fey Ancestry
You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

#### Skill Versatility
You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.

#### Languages
You can speak, read, and write Common, Elvish, and one extra language of your choice.

# D&D\Enciclopédia\Fauna, Flora & Materials\Races\Half-Orcs.md

# Half-Orc
Whether united under the leadership of a mighty warlock or having fought to a standstill after years of conflict, orc and human tribes sometimes form alliances, joining forces into a larger horde to the terror of civilized lands nearby. When these alliances are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs and savage fury.

## Scarred and Strong

Half-orcs’ grayish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and towering builds make their orcish heritage plain for all to see. Half-orcs stand between 5 and 7 feet tall and usually weigh between 180 and 250 pounds.

Orcs regard battle scars as tokens of pride and ornamental scars as things of beauty. Other scars, though, mark an orc or half-orc as a former slave or a disgraced exile. Any half-orc who has lived among or near orcs has scars, whether they are marks of humiliation or of pride, recounting their past exploits and injuries. Such a half-orc living among humans might display these scars proudly or hide them in shame.

## The Mark of Gruumsh

The one-eyed god Gruumsh created the orcs, and even those orcs who turn away from his worship can’t fully escape his influence. The same is true of half-orcs, though their human blood moderates the impact of their orcish heritage. Some half-orcs hear the whispers of Gruumsh in their dreams, calling them to unleash the rage that simmers within them. Others feel Gruumsh’s exultation when they join in melee combat—and either exult along with him or shiver with fear and loathing. Half-orcs are not evil by nature, but evil does lurk within them, whether they embrace it or rebel against it.

Beyond the rage of Gruumsh, half-orcs feel emotion powerfully. Rage doesn’t just quicken their pulse, it makes their bodies burn. An insult stings like acid, and sadness saps their strength. But they laugh loudly and heartily, and simple bodily pleasures—feasting, drinking, wrestling, drumming, and wild dancing—fill their hearts with joy. They tend to be short-tempered and sometimes sullen, more inclined to action than contemplation and to fighting than arguing. The most accomplished half-orcs are those with enough self-control to get by in a civilized land.

## Tribes and Slums

Half-orcs most often live among orcs. Of the other races, humans are most likely to accept half-orcs, and half-orcs almost always live in human lands when not living among orc tribes. Whether proving themselves among rough barbarian tribes or scrabbling to survive in the slums of larger cities, half-orcs get by on their physical might, their endurance, and the sheer determination they inherit from their human ancestry.

## Half-Orc Names

Half-orcs usually have names appropriate to the culture in which they were raised. A half-orc who wants to fit in among humans might trade an orc name for a human name. Some half-orcs with human names decide to adopt a guttural orc name because they think it makes them more intimidating.

**Male Orc Names:** Dench, Feng, Gell, Henk, Holg, Imsh, Keth, Krusk, Mhurren, Ront, Shump, Thokk

**Female Orc Names:** Baggi, Emen, Engong, Kansif, Myev, Neega, Ovak, Ownka, Shautha, Sutha, Vola, Volen, Yevelda  

> **GRUDGING ACCEPTANCE**
> 
> Each half-orc finds a way to gain acceptance from those who hate orcs. Some are reserved, trying not to draw attention to themselves. A few demonstrate piety and good-heartedness as publicly as they can (whether or not such demonstrations are genuine). And some simply try to be so tough that others just avoid them.

## Half-Orc Traits

Your half-orc character has certain traits deriving from your orc ancestry.

#### Ability Score Increase

Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

#### Age

Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans, reaching adulthood around age 14. They age noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years.

#### Alignment

Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos from their orc parents and are not strongly inclined toward good. Half-orcs raised among orcs and willing to live out their lives among them are usually evil.

#### Size

Half-orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.

#### Speed

Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

#### Darkvision

Thanks to your orc blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

#### Menacing

You gain proficiency in the [Intimidation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Intimidation) skill.

#### Relentless Endurance

When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

#### Savage Attacks

When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon’s damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.

#### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Orc. Orc is a harsh, grating language with hard consonants. It has no script of its own but is written in the Dwarvish script.

# D&D\Enciclopédia\Fauna, Flora & Materials\Races\Halflings.md

# Halfling
![D&D's Regis the Halfling](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/003/323/020/large/brian-matyas-regis-concept1.jpg?1472665141)

The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings’ lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along a dirt road or a raft floating downriver.

## Small and Practical

![Dungeon and dragon Halfling](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/001/233/484/large/rudy-siswanto-races-halflingstrongheartmale-d-color.jpg?1442681957)

The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds.

Halflings’ skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors.

Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They’re concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have a knack for finding the most straightforward solution to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.

![Hobbit](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/013/144/807/large/davide-lazzoni-hobbit.jpg?1538268472)

## Kind and Curious

Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among them usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They love discovering new things, even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing.

Halflings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any living thing suffer. They are generous, happily sharing what they have even in lean times.

## Blend into the Crowd

Halflings are adept at fitting into a community of humans, dwarves, or elves, making themselves valuable and welcome. The combination of their inherent stealth and their unassuming nature helps halflings to avoid unwanted attention.

![Halfling bard - dnd commission](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/022/114/975/large/elisa-serio-bard.jpg?1574171681)

Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened.

## Pastoral Pleasantries

Most halflings live in small, peaceful communities with large farms and well-kept groves. They rarely build kingdoms of their own or even hold much land beyond their quiet shires. They typically don’t recognize any sort of halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to family elders to guide them. Families preserve their traditional ways despite the rise and fall of empires.

Many halflings live among other races, where the halflings’ hard work and loyal outlook offer them abundant rewards and creature comforts. Some halfling communities travel as a way of life, driving wagons or guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no permanent home.

Not that there’s anything wrong with the barons and soldiers—you have to admire their conviction. And by protecting their own lands, they protect us as well.”

## Exploring Opportunities

Halflings usually set out on the adventurer’s path to defend their communities, support their friends, or explore a wide and wonder-filled world. For them, adventuring is less a career than an opportunity or sometimes a necessity.

## Halfling Names

A halfling has a given name, a family name, and possibly a nickname. Family names are often nicknames that stuck so tenaciously they have been passed down through the generations.

**Male Names:** Alton, Ander, Cade, Corrin, Eldon, Errich, Finnan, Garret, Lindal, Lyle, Merric, Milo, Osborn, Perrin, Reed, Roscoe, Wellby

**Female Names:** Andry, Bree, Callie, Cora, Euphemia, Jillian, Kithri, Lavinia, Lidda, Merla, Nedda, Paela, Portia, Seraphina, Shaena, Trym, Vani, Verna

**Family Names:** Brushgather, Goodbarrel, Greenbottle, High-hill, Hilltopple, Leagallow, Tealeaf, Thorngage, Tosscobble, Underbough

## Subrace

The two main kinds of halfling, lightfoot and stout, are more like closely related families than true subraces. Choose one of these subraces or one from another source.

## Halfling Traits

Your halfling character has a number of traits in common with all other halflings.

#### Ability Score Increase

Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

#### Age

A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century.

#### Alignment

Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways.

#### Size

Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.

#### Speed

Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

#### Lucky

When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

#### Brave

You have advantage on saving throws against being [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened).

#### Halfling Nimbleness

#### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.

### Lightfoot Halfling
![Rorimac Pennywhistle](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/002/545/158/large/graey-erb-cleric.jpg?1462960783)

As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You’re inclined to be affable and get along well with others. In the Forgotten Realms, lightfoot halflings have spread the farthest and thus are the most common variety.

Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life. In the world of Greyhawk, these halflings are called hairfeet or tallfellows.

#### Ability Score Increase

Your Charisma score increases by 1.

#### Naturally Stealthy

You can attempt to [hide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Hide) even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.

### Stout Halfling
![Halfling Male Fighter](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/034/070/665/large/ilina-naydenova-.jpg?1611314673)

As a stout halfling, you’re hardier than average and have some resistance to poison. Some say that stouts have dwarven blood. In the Forgotten Realms, these halflings are called stronghearts, and they’re most common in the south.

#### Ability Score Increase

Your Constitution score increases by 1.

#### Stout Resilience

You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.

In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the common races, late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder races, and that’s why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.

![Landscapes of Tal'dorei Part 2](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/006/809/669/large/kent-davis-emonharbor-02.jpg?1501434059)

## A Broad Spectrum
With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than other common races. There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. A lot of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elf, orc, or other lineages. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a single century.

## Variety in All Things
Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle, though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human’s memory. They live fully in the present—making them well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.  

![Kitbash 3D Medieval Market ](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/023/222/447/large/pablo-dominguez-kitbash3d-medievalmarket-v001-002.jpg?1578506413)

> **EVERYONE'S SECOND-BEST FRIENDS**
> 
> Just as readily as they mix with each other, humans mingle with members of other races. They get along with almost everyone, though they might not be close to many. Humans serve as ambassadors, diplomats, magistrates, merchants, and functionaries of all kinds.
> 
> _**[[Dwarves]].**_ “They’re stout folk, stalwart friends, and true to their word. Their greed for gold is their downfall, though.”
> 
> _**[[Elves]].**_ “It’s best not to wander into elven woods. They don’t like intruders, and you’ll as likely be bewitched as peppered with arrows. Still, if an elf can get past that damned racial pride and actually treat you like an equal, you can learn a lot from them.”
> 
> _**[[Halflings]].**_ “It’s hard to beat a meal in a halfling home, as long as you don’t crack your head on the ceiling—good food and good stories in front of a nice, warm fire. If halflings had a shred of ambition, they might really amount to something.”

## Lasting Institutions
Where a single elf or dwarf might take on the responsibility of guarding a special location or a powerful secret, humans found sacred orders and institutions for such purposes. While dwarf clans and halfling elders pass on the ancient traditions to each new generation, human temples, governments, libraries, and codes of law fix their traditions in the bedrock of history. Humans dream of immortality, but (except for those few who seek undeath or divine ascension to escape death’s clutches) they achieve it by ensuring that they will be remembered when they are gone.

Although some humans can be xenophobic, in general their societies are inclusive. Human lands welcome large numbers of nonhumans compared to the proportion of humans who live in nonhuman lands.

## Exemplars of Ambition
Humans who seek adventure are the most daring and ambitious members of a daring and ambitious race. They seek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows by amassing power, wealth, and fame. More than other people, humans champion causes rather than territories or groups.

## Human Names and Ethnicities
Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans as a whole have no typical names. Some human parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less correctly), but most parents give names that are linked to their region’s culture or to the naming traditions of their ancestors.

![Humans - Character design warmup](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/028/169/193/large/sariel-snowings-asset.jpg?1593678515)

The material culture and physical characteristics of humans can change wildly from region to region. In the Forgotten Realms, for example, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature are different in the northwestern lands of the Silver Marches than in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east—and even more distinctive in far-off Kara-Tur. Human physical characteristics, though, vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of the Silver Marches have every possible variation of coloration and features.

In the Forgotten Realms, nine human ethnic groups are widely recognized, though over a dozen others are found in more localized areas of Faerûn. These groups, and the typical names of their members, can be used as inspiration no matter which world your human is in.

#### Calishite

![Zadash | Critical Role Wiki | Fandom](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/criticalrole/images/8/8b/BlackSalander_Zadash.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180704134138)

#### Mulan
Dominant in the eastern and southeastern shores of the Inner Sea, the Mulan are generally tall, slim, and amber-skinned, with eyes of hazel or brown.

Widespread along the entire Sword Coast at the western edge of Faerûn, Tethyrians are of medium build and height, with dusky skin that tends to grow fairer the farther north they dwell. Their hair and eye color varies widely, but brown hair and blue eyes are the most common. Tethyrians primarily use Chondathan names.

#### Turami
Native to the southern shore of the Inner Sea, the Turami people are generally tall and muscular, with dark mahogany skin, curly black hair, and dark eyes.

**Turami Names:** (Male) Anton, Diero, Marcon, Pieron, Rimardo, Romero, Salazar, Umbero; (female) Balama, Dona, Faila, Jalana, Luisa, Marta, Quara, Selise, Vonda; (surnames) Agosto, Astorio, Calabra, Domine, Falone, Marivaldi, Pisacar, Ramondo

### Description

Orcs are savage humanoids with stooped postures, piggish faces, and prominent teeth that resemble tusks. They gather in tribes that satisfy their bloodlust by slaying any humanoids that stand against them.

Orcs are savage raiders and pillagers with stooped postures, low foreheads, and piggish faces with prominent lower canines that resemble tusks.

![Fighting in the harpy nest](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/015/624/377/large/bayard-wu-fighting-in-the-harpy-nest.jpg?1549008778)

_**Gruumsh One-Eye.**_ Orcs worship Gruumsh, the mightiest of the orc deities and their creator. The orcs believe that in ancient days, the gods gathered to divide the world among their followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mountains, he learned they had been taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but those had been settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other races would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.

Orcs hold a particular hatred for elves. The elven god Corellon Larethian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god’s eye. Since then, the orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering elves. Turning his injury into a baleful gift, Gruumsh grants divine might to any champion who willingly plucks out one of its eyes in his honor.

![Orc](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/006/086/646/large/smile-_z-2011815171.jpg?1495968059)

_**Tribes like Plagues.**_ Orcs gather in tribes that exert their dominance and satisfy their bloodlust by plundering villages, devouring or driving off roaming herds, and slaying any humanoids that stand against them. After savaging a settlement, orcs pick it clean of wealth and items usable in their own lands. They set the remains of villages and camps ablaze, then retreat whence they came, their bloodlust satisfied.

_**Ranging Scavengers.**_ Their lust for slaughter demands that orcs dwell always within striking distance of new targets. As such, they seldom settle permanently, instead converting ruins, cavern complexes, and defeated foes’ villages into fortified camps and strongholds. Orcs build only for defense, making no innovation or improvement to their lairs beyond mounting the severed body parts of their victims on spiked stockade walls or pikes jutting up from moats and trenches.

When an existing territory is depleted of food, an orc tribe divides into roving bands that scout for choice hunting grounds. When each party returns, it brings back trophies and news of targets ripe for attack, the richest of which is chosen. The tribe then sets out en masse to carve a bloody path to its new territory.

On rare occasions, a tribe’s leader chooses to hold onto a particularly defensible lair for decades. The orcs of such a tribe must range far across the countryside to sate their appetites.

![ Ms.Orc- Queen](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/005/553/348/large/bayard-wu-orc-queen.jpg?1491921214)

_**Leadership and Might.**_ Orc tribes are mostly patriarchal, flaunting such vivid or grotesque titles as Many-Arrows, Screaming Eye, and Elf Ripper. Occasionally, a powerful war chief unites scattered orc tribes into a single rampaging horde, which runs roughshod over other orc tribes and humanoid settlements from a position of overwhelming strength.

Strength and power are the greatest of orcish virtues, and orcs embrace all manner of mighty creatures in their tribes. Rejecting notions of racial purity, they proudly welcome ogres, trolls, half-orcs, and orogs into their ranks. As well, orcs respect and fear the size and power of evil giants, and often serve them as guards and soldiers.

_**Orc Crossbreeds.**_ Luthic, the orc goddess of fertility and wife of Gruumsh, demands that orcs procreate often and indiscriminately so that orc hordes swell generation after generation. The orcs’ drive to reproduce runs stronger than any other humanoid race, and they readily crossbreed with other races. When an orc procreates with a non-orc humanoid of similar size and stature (such as a human or a dwarf), the resulting child is either an orc or a half-orc. When an orc produces young with an ogre, the child is a half-ogre of intimidating strength and brutish features called an ogrillon.

### Rare or Mundane? 
Consider how common ore, goblin, and similar ad-venturers are in your setting. Are they regarded as no stranger than elves or dwarves? Are they met with suspicion? The role these races play in your setting should determine the kinds of reactions that such char-acters meet. 
Don't be afraid to push things to an extreme. An ore character might have to venture into town in disguise or remain in the wilderness, for fear of imprisonment or mob violence. Be sure to talk to the group about how such characters can expect the world to treat them. Some players like the challenge of taking on an outcast, but don't set up one expectation and deliver another. 
You can establish a monstrous creature as just an-other culture in your campaign, one that has alliances and rivalries with humans, elves, and dwarves. A hobgoblin kingdom might serve as a buffer between a human kingdom and a blighted region overrun by the spawn of Kyuss. Kobolds might be city builders, the architects of grand, heavily fortified edifices, which other folk dwell in for a price. The cultural notes in chapter 1 are the standard D&D depiction of these creatures, but by no means do they define them for your campaign. Use them as a starting point for your own ideas.

### Outcast or Ambassador?
Consider how a monstrous character's native culture views the character. Is the character an outcast, a spy, an ambassador, or something else? Work with the player to determine how the character ended up as an adventurer. 
The character's bond is a great starting point to con-sider for this question. How did the bond drive the char-acter to adventure? The character's trait, flaw, and ideal can also play a role in fleshing out the story. 

### Friends or Enemies?
Figure out what special ties the character has to other members of the adventuring party. An ore warlock might be the dwarf ranger's sworn enemy, but the two are forced to work together to defeat a mutual foe. Per-haps the kobold sorcerer was the tiefling wizard's famil-iar, transformed by an irate archmage in return for some petty insult. The hobgoblin paladin might have been human once, but crossed the wrong hag and was cursed to take on an evil guise. A creative tie betw,een a mon-strous character and the rest of the party helps make for a memorable campaign.

# Tiefling
To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. And to twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus—overlord of the Nine Hells—into their bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children’s children will always be held accountable.

## Infernal Bloodline

Tieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the broadest possible sense, they still look human. However, their infernal heritage has left a clear imprint on their appearance. Tieflings have large horns that take any of a variety of shapes: some have curling horns like a ram, others have straight and tall horns like a gazelle’s, and some spiral upward like an antelopes’ horns. They have thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid colors—black, red, white, silver, or gold—with no visible sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full range of human coloration, but also include various shades of red. Their hair, cascading down from behind their horns, is usually dark, from black or brown to dark red, blue, or purple.

## Self-Reliant and Suspicious

Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers, thieves, or crime lords. Sometimes they live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with more respect.

Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own way in the world and that they have to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a tiefling’s companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefling learns to extend the same trust to them. And once a tiefling gives someone loyalty, the tiefling is a firm friend or ally for life.

## Tiefling Names

Tiefling names fall into three broad categories. Tieflings born into another culture typically have names reflective of that culture. Some have names derived from the Infernal language, passed down through generations, that reflect their fiendish heritage. And some younger tieflings, striving to find a place in the world, adopt a name that signifies a virtue or other concept and then try to embody that concept. For some, the chosen name is a noble quest. For others, it’s a grim destiny.

**Male Infernal Names:** Akmenos, Amnon, Barakas, Damakos, Ekemon, Iados, Kairon, Leucis, Melech, Mordai, Morthos, Pelaios, Skamos, Therai

**Female Infernal Names:** Akta, Anakis, Bryseis, Criella, Damaia, Ea, Kallista, Lerissa, Makaria, Nemeia, Orianna, Phelaia, Rieta

**“Virtue” Names:** Art, Carrion, Chant, Creed, Despair, Excellence, Fear, Glory, Hope, Ideal, Music, Nowhere, Open, Poetry, Quest, Random, Reverence, Sorrow, Temerity, Torment, Weary  

> **MUTUAL MISTRUST**
> 
> People tend to be suspicious of tieflings, assuming that their infernal heritage has left its mark on their personality and morality, not just their appearance. Shopkeepers keep a close eye on their goods when tieflings enter their stores, the town watch might follow a tiefling around for a while, and demagogues blame tieflings for strange happenings. The reality, though, is that a tiefling’s bloodline doesn’t affect his or her personality to any great degree. Years of dealing with mistrust does leave its mark on most tieflings, and they respond to it in different ways. Some choose to live up to the wicked stereotype, but others are virtuous. Most are simply very aware of how people respond to them. After dealing with this mistrust throughout youth, a tiefling often develops the ability to overcome prejudice through charm or intimidation.

When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The sword uses your [](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Appendix%20B%20-%20Combat#h-Attack)[](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#h-Attack)[](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Actions%20in%20Combat#h-Attack)[Attack](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#h-Attack) roll and ability score modifier to [Damage Rolls](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Appendix%20B%20-%20Combat#h-Damage%20Rolls).  
  
While the sword hovers, you can use a [Bonus Action](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Casting%20a%20Spell#h-Bonus%20Action) to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you.

After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30 feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.

# D&D\Enciclopédia\Items\Obsidian Veil.md

# Obsidian Veil

_Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement by a spellcaster)_

---
![[obsidian_veil.jpg]]

**Description:** The Obsidian Veil is a hauntingly beautiful crystalline tapestry that seems to absorb surrounding light. It has a mirror-like finish in which faint, shadowy figures appear and shift. The Veil emits occasional whispers only audible to the attuned, carrying traces of distant voices and faint moans. Fine, vein-like striations of dark silver run through the black stone, with a faint purple sheen giving it an otherworldly allure.

**Properties of the Obsidian Veil:**

- **Whispers of the Veil.** While attuned to the Veil, you can cast _speak with dead_ once per day without using a spell slot. However, each time you do so, make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you hear disembodied whispers for 1 hour, imposing disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks as they echo in your mind.
    
- **Divination and Dark Insight.** The Obsidian Veil grants you insight into the unknown. Once per long rest, you may cast _augury_ or _detect thoughts_ without expending a spell slot. However, each time you do so, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage as the whispers seep further into your mind.
    
- **Spectral Communion.** You can communicate with spirits trapped within the Veil. As an action, you can attempt to commune with one of these entities, asking it one question. The spirit answers in a cryptic manner, bound by old grudges and half-forgotten memories, and is only inclined to help if it furthers its own agenda.
    
- **Veil’s Curse.** The Veil gradually frays the sanity of its user. Each week the Veil is attuned, the attuned must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they gain one level of exhaustion that can only be removed by a _greater restoration_ spell or a long rest without the Veil.
    

**Destroying the Obsidian Veil:** The Veil can only be destroyed by a _dispel evil and good_ spell cast on it during a lunar eclipse, which releases the spirits within. However, those attempting this ritual must first overcome a powerful necromantic curse (DC 17 Constitution saving throw) or suffer disadvantage on all Wisdom-based checks until the curse is lifted.

# D&D\Enciclopédia\Items\Artifacts\Shards of Potential.md

# **Shards of Potential**

_Wondrous Item, Legendary (Artifact) (requires attunement by a spellcaster)_

**Description:**  
The **Shards of Potential** are remnants of a forgotten artifact created by **Ahmis, the God of the Void**, and **Aenar, the Goddess of Magic**. These crystalline fragments hum with raw arcane energy, resonating with the fundamental forces that shape the world. Each shard is unique in shape, size, and color, but all share an otherworldly luminescence that seems to shimmer between reality and possibility.

Mages and artificers seek these shards for their ability to **enhance**, **channel**, and even **reshape** magic itself. Whether embedded into a staff, woven into armor, or used to fuel grand arcane constructs, the Shards of Potential unlock untapped reservoirs of magical power.

---

### **Properties of the Shards**

Each **Shard of Potential** holds immense magical energy and can be used in several ways:

#### **Raw Potential**

A creature attuned to a Shard gains a **+2 bonus to spell attack rolls and spell save DC** while wielding it.

#### **Arcane Conduit**

While holding a Shard, you can cast any spell you know or have prepared as if it were cast at one level higher than the spell slot expended. If the spell is already cast at 9th level, roll a d6. On a 6, the spell’s effects are **doubled**, but the shard **cracks**, losing its magic permanently.

#### **Spell Infusion**

A Shard of Potential can be embedded into a magical item, enhancing its properties based on the shard’s attunement. The DM determines the specific enchantment, but examples include:

- **Weapon:** Gains the ability to deal an additional 2d8 force damage per hit.
- **Staff:** Allows an additional casting of a prepared spell per day without expending a spell slot.
- **Armor:** Grants resistance to a damage type associated with the embedded shard (force, necrotic, radiant, psychic, etc.).
- **Construct:** Allows a magical construct to self-repair, regaining 1d10 hit points at the start of each of its turns.

#### **Weave Unraveling**

As an action, a creature attuned to the Shard can attempt to **unravel magic** itself. The user may cast **Dispel Magic** or **Counterspell** at 9th level once per long rest. Additionally, the wielder can target a **magical effect, portal, or construct**, forcing it to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be **temporarily disabled for 1 minute**.

#### **Fragment of the Lost Artifact**

The Shards of Potential are mere fragments of something far greater. If multiple shards are brought together, their magic may interact in unpredictable ways. If **three or more shards** are combined into a single artifact, their power **intensifies**, potentially unlocking unknown effects or even **revealing the true nature of the lost artifact** they came from.

---

### **Optional DM Effects**

Because the shards are remnants of an artifact tied to Ahmis and Aenar, they may have additional effects depending on their wielder or circumstances:

- **Reality Shifts:** Using a shard near **a place of great magical power** (such as a leyline nexus) may cause unpredictable magical phenomena, such as temporary wild magic surges or planar rifts.
- **Sentience?:** Some scholars speculate that each shard retains **a fragment of knowledge from Ahmis and Aenar**—perhaps even whispers of their lost creation.
- **Corruption or Purity:** A shard exposed to prolonged use may shift in nature, amplifying **either order (Aenar’s influence) or chaos (Ahmis’ void magic)**.

---

### **Legendary Lore**

Those who study the origins of the **Shards of Potential** often seek ancient ruins or lost vaults where they may still rest. Some believe that collecting all the shards would allow a wielder to **recreate the artifact Ahmis and Aenar forged**, restoring its lost power—or unleashing a force beyond mortal comprehension.

**"These are not mere crystals, but echoes of a lost truth. To wield one is to touch the fabric of the arcane itself."** — **Tulanir, Wizard of the Scented Spire**

# D&D\Enciclopédia\Items\Artifacts\Staff of Chaos.md

# **Staff of Chaos**

_Staff, Legendary (Artifact) (requires attunement by a spellcaster)_

**Description:**  
A staff of constantly shifting form, the **Staff of Chaos** is a conduit of pure, untamed arcane energy. Its wood and metal-like structure continuously bends, melts, and reforms, flickering between solid and liquid states. The head of the staff houses [[The Unbound Nexus]], a [[Shards of Potential|Shard of Potential]] that fuels its unpredictable power. Those who wield it gain unparalleled magical prowess—but must also embrace **the uncertainty of wild magic**.

### **Properties:**

- **Arcane Instability.** While attuned to this staff, you gain **+3 to spell attack rolls and spell save DCs**.
- **Wild Magic Surge.** Whenever you cast a spell of **1st level or higher**, roll a **d20**. On a roll of **1–5**, a **wild magic surge** occurs, as determined by the Wild Magic Surge table (PHB, p. 104). If you already have the Wild Magic Sorcerer feature, you **roll twice** on the table and pick either result.
- **Chaotic Casting.** You can cast spells **without expending a spell slot**—however, the spell level is determined **randomly** by rolling a **1d8** (1: 1st-level, 2: 2nd-level, etc. up to 8th-level). If you roll a level higher than your spell's normal level, it is **cast at that higher level** for free. If you roll lower, the spell **fails entirely** and triggers a wild magic surge.
- **Tides of Change.** As a reaction when you see a creature within 30 feet cast a spell, you can **alter its nature**. Roll a **1d6**:
    - **1–2:** The spell is **weakened**—its range is halved and its damage is reduced by 1d8.
    - **3–4:** The spell is **altered**—its element (fire, cold, lightning, etc.) randomly changes.
    - **5–6:** The spell is **empowered**—its effects are maximized, but it also triggers a **wild magic surge**.  
        This ability can be used **3 times per long rest**.

### **Unleashing Chaos (Ultimate Power)**

Once per long rest, as an action, you may **fully unleash the chaotic energy of the staff**, triggering **one of the following effects (your choice):**

1. **Reality Fracture:** You create a **temporary rift in reality**, teleporting up to **five willing creatures** within 120 feet to **a different plane** of existence for 1 minute before they are pulled back.
2. **Arcane Detonation:** A **chaotic explosion of raw magic** erupts in a **60-foot radius** around you, dealing **12d12 force damage** to all creatures (DC 20 Dexterity save for half damage). All spells in the area immediately end.
3. **Storm of Unmaking:** The wielder **loses control of magic itself**—for the next **minute**, every spell cast by any creature within 120 feet **automatically triggers a wild magic surge**.

### **Cursed Nature**

- **Uncontrollable Arcana:** The wielder cannot prepare spells that require **material components worth 1,000 gp or more**, as the staff **rejects structured magic**.
- **Tether to Chaos:** If the staff is **removed from the wielder’s possession** for more than 24 hours, it **teleports back to them**, unless in an **anti-magic field**.
- **Sentient Madness:** The staff **whispers in the wielder’s mind**, suggesting impulsive or unpredictable actions. A character attuned to the staff must make a **DC 18 Wisdom saving throw** every **week**, or gain a **Short-Term Madness effect** (DMG, p. 259).

### **Destroying the Staff of Chaos:**

The staff can only be destroyed in **a moment of absolute cosmic stillness**—a paradoxical event that would require **stopping all wild magic across the multiverse for a full minute**, an impossible task without the intervention of **At’ar, God of Balance** himself.

- **Unstable Aftershock.** Whenever you deal **force, fire, or lightning damage**, all creatures within **10 feet** of the target take **2d8 force damage**.
- **Collapse of Form.** Once per day, as an action, you can choose a point within **60 feet**. All creatures in a **20-foot radius** must make a **DC 18 Strength saving throw** or be pulled **10 feet toward the point and restrained for 1 minute**.

- **Spell Evolution.** Each day at dawn, choose **one spell from any spell list**—you can cast it once that day without expending a spell slot.
- **Shifting Power.** When casting a spell, you may roll a **1d4**. On a 4, the spell is cast **one level higher** for free.
- **Fate Reforged.** **Once in your lifetime**, you may make a **reality-altering wish**—this functions as the **Wish spell**, but with unknown and potentially cosmic consequences.
- **Final Act.** After using Fate Reforged, the Seed of Possibility vanishes from reality, never to be found again.

**Destroying the Seed of Possibility:** The shard does not seem to be destructible—rather, it will simply disappear when it has fulfilled its unknown purpose.

# D&D\Enciclopédia\Items\Artifacts\The Silent Echo.md

# **The Silent Echo**

_Weapon (Dagger or Shortsword), Legendary (Artifact) (requires attunement)_

**Description:**  
This **black shard absorbs all sound** around it. No matter how sharp, it makes no noise when striking. In complete silence, the wielder can hear their own heartbeat unnaturally loud.

# D&D\Enciclopédia\Items\Artifacts\The Unbound Nexus.md

# **The Unbound Nexus**

_Wondrous Item, Legendary (Artifact) (requires attunement by a spellcaster)_

**Description:**  
This constantly shifting shard of prismatic energy pulses with chaotic magic, its colors never settling for long. When held, it fills the air with static, and its wielder's spells ripple unpredictably. It is embedded in the **Staff of Chaos**, where it fuels wild magic in its most untamed form.

### **Properties:**

- **Wild Arcana.** While attuned to this shard, you gain **+2 to spell attack rolls and spell save DCs**.
- **Chaotic Surge.** Whenever you cast a spell of **1st level or higher**, roll a **d20**. On a **1–5**, a **wild magic surge** occurs, as determined by the Wild Magic Surge table (PHB, p. 104).
- **Spell Flux.** When you cast a spell of **5th level or lower**, you can roll **1d6**. On a roll of **6**, the spell does not consume a spell slot.
- **Tides of Madness.** If you roll a **wild magic surge**, you may **choose the effect instead of rolling**, but you must complete a **long rest** before doing so again.

**Destroying the Veilpiercer:** The shard can only be shattered by closing **ten planar rifts at once**, an act requiring immense power and precise timing.

Tulanir is a reclusive wizard specializing in Transmutation and Alchemical Magic. His mastery over exotic fragrances, which serve as magical components in his spells, has earned his tower the name "Scented Spire." Tulanir is a man of few words, seen by many as eccentric, and his magical prowess is renowned across Varatha. His experiments are often mysterious and sometimes dangerous, and his aloof nature leaves him shrouded in mystery. However, he occasionally assists the city with complex magical issues, especially those related to alchemical transmutations.

# Economic Systems

## Barter system
In [trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade), **barter** (derived from _baretor_[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barter#cite_note-1)) is a system of [exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_(economics) "Exchange (economics)") in which participants in a [transaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_transaction "Financial transaction") directly exchange [goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_(economics) "Good (economics)") or [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(economics)) for other goods or services without using a [medium of exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_of_exchange "Money"), such as [money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barter#cite_note-2) [Economists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economists) distinguish barter from [gift economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy "Gift economy") in many ways; barter, for example, features immediate [reciprocal exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(cultural_anthropology) "Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)"), not one delayed in time. Barter usually takes place on a [bilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_trade "Service (economics)") basis, but may be [multilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateral_exchange "Multilateral exchange") (if it is mediated through a [trade exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_exchange "Trade exchange")). In most [developed countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_countries "Developed countries"), barter usually exists parallel to [monetary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary "Monetary") systems only to a very limited extent. Market actors use barter as a replacement for money as the method of exchange in times of [monetary crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_crisis "Monetary crisis"), such as when [currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency "Currency") becomes unstable (such as [hyperinflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation "Hyperinflation") or a [deflationary spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation#Deflationary_spiral "Deflation")) or simply unavailable for conducting [commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce "Commerce").

## Command/Planned economy

## Gift economy
A **gift economy** or **gift culture** is a mode of exchange where [valuables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropological_theories_of_value "Anthropological theories of value") are not sold, but rather given without an explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy#cite_note-Cheal-1) Social norms and customs govern giving a gift in a gift culture, gifts are not given in an explicit exchange of goods or services for [money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money "Money"), or some other [commodity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity "Commodity") or service.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy#cite_note-R._Kranton-2) This contrasts with a [barter economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barter_economy "Barter economy") or a [market economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy "Market economy"), where [goods and services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services "Goods and services") are primarily explicitly exchanged for value received.

## Market economy

## Mixed economy

## Palace economy
A **palace economy** or **redistribution economy**[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_economy#cite_note-1) is a system of economic organization in which a substantial share of the wealth flows into the control of a centralized administration, the [palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace "Palace"), and out from there to the general population, which may be allowed its own sources of income but relies heavily on the wealth redistributed by the palace. It was traditionally justified on the principle that the palace was most capable of distributing wealth efficiently for the benefit of society.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_economy#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_economy#cite_note-3) The **temple economy** or **temple-state economy** are similar concepts.

# D&D\Ferramentas\Worldbuilding\Organizations\Religious\Divine Domains.md

## Arcana
_Source: Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide_

![[Arcana.jpg]]

Magic is an energy that suffuses the multiverse and that fuels both destruction and creation. Gods of the Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic intimately. For some of these gods, magical knowledge is a great responsibility that comes with a special understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its wielder sees fit.

The gods of this domain are often associated with knowledge, as learning and arcane power tend to go hand-in-hand. In the Realms, deities of this domain include Azuth and Mystra, as well as Corellon Larethian of the elven pantheon. In other worlds, this domain includes Hecate, Math Mathonwy, and Isis; the triple moon gods of Solinari, Lunitari, and Nuitari of Krynn; and Boccob, Vecna, and Wee Jas of Greyhawk.

## Blood
_Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting_

![[Blood.jpg]]

The Blood domain centers around the understanding of the natural life force within one’s own physical body. The power of blood is the power of sacrifice, the balance of life and death, and the spirit’s anchor within the mortal shell. Clerics of blood seek to tap into the connection between body and soul through divine means, exploit the hidden reserves of will within one’s own vitality, and even manipulate or corrupt the body of others through these secret rites of crimson.

## Death
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide_

![[Death.jpg]]

The Death domain is concerned with the forces that cause death, as well as the negative energy that gives rise to undead creatures. Deities such as Chemosh, Myrkul, and Wee Jas are patrons of necromancers, death knights, liches, mummy lords, and vampires. Gods of the Death domain also embody murder (Anubis, Bhaal, and Pyremius), pain (Iuz or Loviatar), disease or poison (Incabulos, Talona, or Morgion), and the underworld (Hades and Hel)

## Forge
_Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything_

![[Forge.jpg]]

The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to the mighty elf artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithral have felled demon lords. The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items. Followers of these gods take great pride in their work, and they are willing to craft and use heavy armor and powerful weapons to protect them. Deities of this domain include Gond, Reorx, Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.

## Grave
Gods of the grave watch over the line between life and death. To these deities, death and the afterlife are a foundational part of the multiverse’s workings. To resist death, or to desecrate the dead’s rest, is an abomination. Deities of the grave include Kelemvor, Wee Jas, the ancestral spirits of the Undying Court, Hades, Anubis, and Osiris. These deities teach their followers to respect the dead and pay them due homage. Followers of these deities seek to put restless spirits to rest, destroy the undead wherever they find them, and ease the suffering of dying creatures. Their magic also allows them to stave off a creature’s death, though they refuse to use such magic to extend a creature’s lifespan beyond its mortal limits.

## Knowledge
_Source: Player's Handbook_

![[Knowledge.jpg]]

The gods of knowledge – including Oghma, Boccob, Gilean, Aureon, and Thoth – value learning and understanding above all. Some teach that knowledge is to be gathered and shared in libraries and universities, or promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention. Some deities hoard knowledge and keep its secrets to themselves. And some promise their followers that they will gain tremendous power if they unlock the secrets of the multiverse. Followers of these gods study esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into the secret places of the earth, and learn all they can. Some gods of knowledge promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention, including smith deities like Gond, Reorx, Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.

In Amonkhet, knowledge is the second virtue of society. Kefnet’s task is to pass on this teaching of the God-Pharaoh and elucidate its meaning. He teaches that the afterlife will be inhabited only by those who have proved by their wits that they are worthy of dwelling in the glorious presence of the God-Pharaoh. He trains acolytes and initiates to push their limits and challenge their mental capacity with spells of ever-greater power.

## Life
_Source: Player's Handbook_

![[Life.jpg]]

The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy – one of the fundamental forces of the universe – that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrci).

## Light
_Source: Player's Handbook_

![[Light.jpg]]

Gods of light – including Helm, Lathander, Pholtus, Branchala, the Silver Flame, Belenus, Apollo, and Re-Horakhty – promote the ideals of rebirth and renewal, truth, vigilance, and beauty, often using the symbol of the sun. Some of these gods are portrayed as the sun itself or as a charioteer who guides the sun across the sky. Others are tireless sentinels whose eyes pierce every shadow and see through every deception. Some are deities of beauty and artistry, who teach that art is a vehicle for the soul's improvement. Clerics of a god of light are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their gods' discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.

## Nature
_Source: Player's Handbook_

![[Nature.jpg]]

Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world itself; from inscrutable gods of the deep forests (such as Silvanus, Obad-Hai, Chislev, Balinor, and Pan) to friendly deities associated with particular springs and groves (such as Eldath). Druids revere nature as a whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their own secret tongue. But many of these gods have clerics as well, champions who take a more active role in advancing the interests of a particular nature god. These clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, or wither the crops of those who anger their gods.

## Order
_Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything_

![[Order.png]]

The Order Domain represents discipline, as well as devotion to the laws that govern a society, an institution, or a philosophy. Clerics of Order meditate on logic and justice as they serve their gods, examples of which appear in the Order Deities table.

Clerics of Order believe that well-crafted laws establish legitimate hierarchies, and those selected by law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must do so to the best of their ability, and if those who lead fail to protect the law, they must be replaced. In this manner, law weaves a web of obligations that create order and security in a chaotic multiverse.

## Peace
_Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything_

![[Peace.jpg]]

The balm of peace thrives at the heart of healthy communities, between friendly nations, and in the souls of the kindhearted. The gods of peace inspire people of all sorts to resolve conflict and to stand up against those forces that try to prevent peace from flourishing. See the Peace Deities table for a list of some of the gods associated with this domain.

Clerics of the Peace Domain preside over the signing of treaties, and they are often asked to arbitrate in disputes. These clerics' blessings draw people together and help them shoulder one another's burdens, and the clerics' magic aids those who are driven to fight for the way of peace.


## Tempest
_Source: Player's Handbook_

![[Tempest.jpg]]

Gods whose portfolios include the Tempest domain – including Talos, Umberlee, Kord, Zeboim, the Devourer, Zeus, and Thor – govern storms, sea, and, sky. They include gods of lightning and thunder, gods of earthquakes, some fire gods, and certain gods of violence, physical strength, and courage. In some pantheons, a god of this domain rules over other deities and is known for swift justice delivered by thunderbolts. In the pantheons of seafaring people, gods of this domain are ocean deities and the patrons of sailors. Tempest gods send their clerics to inspire fear in the common folk, either to keep those folk on the path of righteousness or to encourage them to offer sacrifices of propitiation to ward off divine wrath.

## Trickery
_Source: Player's Handbook_



Gods of trickery – such as Tymora, Beshaba, Olidammara, the Traveler, Garl Glittergold, and Loki – are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They're patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Their clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge, pranks, deception, and theft rather than direct confrontation.

## Twilight
_Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything_

![[Twilight.png]]

The twilit transition from light into darkness often brings calm and even joy, as the day's labors end and the hours of rest begin. The darkness can also bring terrors, but the gods of twilight guard against the horrors of the night.

Clerics who serve these deities-examples of which appear on the Twilight Deities table-bring comfort to those who seek rest and protect them by venturing into the encroaching darkness to ensure that the dark is a comfort, not a terror.

## War
_Source: Player's Handbook_

![[War.jpg]]

War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and Kiri-Jolith) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares) and gods of conquest and domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and Maglubiyet). Other war gods (such as Tempus, Nike, and Nuada) take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.

# 626 5.A. 

## Conflicts
-   The town of Greenest comes under attack from the Cult of the Dragon.
-   The Green Dragon Mask is recovered from the lair of Claugiyliamatar in Kryptgarden Forest. Old Gnawbone herself was injured while blows were struck against Thay, the Cult of the Dragon and the Zartruss hobgoblin clan.
-   Vorgansharax attacks and conquers Phlan with the aid of an army of dragon cultists that boil up from beneath the city. The dragon erects a cage of magical thorns around Phlan, sealing it off from the outside to ensure the dragon's dominance.
-   Unther tries to invade Tymanther for a second time, but the Untherite navy is unable to overcome the dragon turtle that protects Djerad Kethendi. Mulhorand fortify its borders with the two countries to avoid the conflict to spill in his lands.
-   Xardock Sunblight plots an invasion of Icewind Dale, and unleashes his chardalyn dragon on Ten Towns.

## Births
- [[Calendário de Aquarius|Frígius 15]]: Emperor [[Barthra Val'Erin]] is born.

## Deaths
- Ector Brahms is killed by Vorgansharax and his body destroyed.

## Deities
-   Lord Ao decrees the end of the Era of Upheaval "Era of Upheaval").
-   The gods begin to talk to their followers again, but their influence is subtler than before. New priesthoods arose to interpret the new behaviour of the gods.
-   In Flamerule, Eilistraee and Vhaeraun fully reacquired the power that they had possessed before 1375 DR. They held their own old portfolios, and were separate entities (Eilistraee was still a drow goddess, as were most of their followers--not dark elves, despite a spell cast by Q'arlynd Melarn in 1379 DR), but they managed to reach a reciprocal understanding, respect, and even a truce (although their followers still skirmished often). Both Eilistraee and Vhaeraun personally announced their return to the Realms, manifesting through their avatars to their followers.

## Environment
- In Icewind Dale, the nonstop two-year winter of Auril's Everlasting Rime ends.

## Organizations
- The Court of Three, a secret society made up of shadovar survivors is established in one of the more intact towers of the Citadel of the Raven.

## Migrations
-   The rebellion against the rule of Vorgansharax, having failed, causes Phlan's refugees to flee to Mulmaster.

## People
-   Severin Silrajin, under orders from Tiamat, attempts to create the Mask of the Dragon Queen to free her from the Nine Hells and collect a treasure hoard that she might deem worthy.
-   The dragon Throstulgrael achieves dracolichdom.
-   Tyranthraxus returns to the Realms through a newly unearthed pool of radiance and possesses the body of Vorgansharax.
-   Ammalia and Victoro Cassalanter sign a pact with Asmodeus trading their children's souls in exchange for financial prosperity. Their eldest son, Osvaldo, is immediately taken, his body transformed into a chain devil.

## Politics
-   The Harpers form a pact with the fey of Kryptgarden forest serving King Witchthorn, an Unseelie lord.
-   A variety of new priesthoods spring up across the Realms to discern the will of the gods in the wake of the Second Sundering.

## Miscellaneous
-   The Lantanese submarine  Scarlet Marpenoth is launched.
-   The nautiloid Id Ascendant crashes in southern Icewind Dale, stranding a crew of two gnome ceremorphs and three gnome squidlings, as well as a compliment of otherworldly pets and living experiments, in the icy region.

## Strength
"Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength." - Sun Tzu

## Casualties
"Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death." - Sun Tzu

## Objectives
"Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants, the aides-de-camp, and door-keepers and sentries of the general in command. Our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these." - Sun Tzu
